## AP Style Feedback

- Change "What do we know about Bigfoot?" to "What Do We Know About Bigfoot?" to adhere to AP style title capitalization.
- Change "From over 4,000 reported sightings" to "From More Than 4,000 Reported Sightings" for consistency with AP style preferences for expressing quantities.
- Change "bigfoot researchers" to "Bigfoot researchers" for consistency since "Bigfoot" is treated as a proper noun throughout the piece.
- Change "bigfoot" to "Bigfoot" throughout the text to maintain proper noun capitalization.
- Change "8 to 10 ft tall" to "8 to 10 feet tall" for consistency with AP style, which spells out measurements.
- Change "Founded in 1996 by Matt Moneymaker" to "Founded in 1996, by Matt Moneymaker," adding a comma after the year for correct punctuation per AP style guidelines.
- Replace "hundreds" with "hundreds of members" to avoid confusion and improve clarity, making it explicit what is being referenced.
- Change "Between 2014 and 2024," to "From 2014 to 2023," assuming the piece's publication is before or during 2023, as future data cannot be analyzed yet.
- Change "knocks" and "wood knocks" to ""Knocks" and "wood knocks"" to indicate direct reference to terms used in reports.
- Change "69 times" to "69 instances" for clarity and specificity.
- Change "Howls, growls and screeches" to "Howls, growls, and screeches," adding an Oxford comma for consistency with AP style.
- Capitalize "bigfoots" when referring to multiple instances of Bigfoot for consistency.
- Change "brown hair" to "Brown hair," "grey hair" to "Gray hair," "blond hair" to "Blond hair," and "and even white hair" to "And even white hair," to begin bullet point content with capital letters and use American English spelling for "gray."
- Change "We think [the colour] may be factors of age." to "We think [the color] may be factors of age," for American English spelling of "color."
- Use figures for time, changing "2.30am" to "2:30 a.m." for consistency with AP style.
- In "It was dark, so I couldn't see any detail in the face," consider changing to direct voice for clarity if part of a direct quote is feasible.
- Change "Class A sightings are visual and Class B sightings are either at a distance of audio" for clarity and specificity: "Class A sightings are visual, while Class B sightings involve auditory evidence or are observed from a distance."
- Change "The guy he was with shined a flashlight on two of them, and then the bigger one came and walked through the trees and came behind him." to maintain clarity, specifying subjects and actions more clearly if the sentence is awkwardly constructed, while ensuring it's within the direct quote's integrity bounds.
- Change "he added." to "He added," if not part of the contiguous quote for correct sentence capitalization.
- Ensure all external links starting with "http://" are changed to "https://" for web security practices, provided they support HTTPS, although this is not directly related to AP style.
