## AP Style Feedback

- Change the title to follow sentence case: "When Was the Best SNL Era, Objectively".
- In the paragraph starting with "A recurring debate amongst internet people is that SNL is getting worse...", change "amongst" to "among" to align with AP style preference for American English.
- In the same paragraph, the mention of the "XYZ" era should use double quotation marks ("XYZ") instead of single, to maintain consistency in quoting.
- Replace "YouTube" with lowercase "youtube" when referring to comments to match AP style's treatment of company names.
- The phrase "As an avid casual watcher of SNL, I have my favourites too", should change "favourites" to "favorites" to adhere to American English spelling as per AP style.
- In the sentence discussing ratings across 46 seasons, replace "46 seasons I look at in the dataset" with "46 seasons examined in the dataset" for a more formal and objective tone.
- Change "Season 3 scored the highest with an average episode rating of 7.2." to include a comma after "highest" for clarity.
- In the Wikipedia reference, the phrase "According to Wikipedia," could be more precisely cited with the article title and date of access, if Wikipedia is considered a reliable source for this context.
- Replace "And yet, Season 28 was the worst scoring season, with an average episode rating of 5.4." with "Yet, Season 28 scored the lowest, with an average episode rating of 5.4.", for more concise wording and to avoid starting a sentence with "And."
- The table content should have "Cast Member" in both header cells capitalized for consistency and formal presentation.
- The reference to Kenan Thompson, "I think Kenan Thompson should be on the list but I guess if the data says he shouldn't then it must be true." should be rephrased for neutrality, such as "Kenan Thompson's absence from the list is notable, indicating the data-driven nature of this analysis."
- In "And if you're curious about the rank of your favourite cast member", change "favourite" to "favorite" for American English spelling.
- For consistency and clarity, ensure that alt texts for all images are descriptive. Where alt text is missing (e.g., `<img src="static/snl-season-3-cast.png" alt="">`), add an informative description.
- The button's text "Search" in the Lookup section should ideally be more descriptive for accessibility purposes, though this falls slightly outside of AP style, it adds to clarity and user experience.
- Lastly, maintain a consistent font case and treatment for all headings and subheadings for a uniform appearance.
