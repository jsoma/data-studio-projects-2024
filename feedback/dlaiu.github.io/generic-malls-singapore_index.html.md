# Feedback for [Why do all malls in Singapore feel the same?](https://dlaiu.github.io/generic-malls-singapore/)

## AP Style Feedback

- Change "Bored of the malls in Singapore?" to "Bored with the malls in Singapore?" for correct preposition use.
- "Bet you $5 you haven't heard of" should be changed to "Bet you five dollars you haven't heard of" to align with AP style of spelling out numbers one through nine.
- "About 8 months ago," should be changed to "About eight months ago," consistent with AP style for spelling out numbers one through nine.
- Remove the quotation marks around "American Shopping Mall" to maintain consistency as it is not a direct quote or title of a work.
- Change "centre" to "center" to align with American English spelling in "a lot of Singapore life and core experiences center around the Singapore mall."
- "a meme of Pam from The Office holding up two photos of two malls in Singapore, with the bottom frame saying 'They're the same picture'" should be rewritten for clarity and brevity in the alt text description.
- In "newly armed with coding and data analysis skills," consider specifying what kind of skills (e.g., "data analysis and coding skills") for clarity.
- In "This was surprising! It contradicts with the glitzy image of downtown Singapore we a familiar with now." it should be "we are familiar with now."
- "For context, LAC is a brand that sells supplements. Why has LAC been proliferating around Singapore? Are that many Singaporeans buying supplements?" could benefit from better clarification between the questions to enhance readability.
- "at least according to this Wikipedia page" could be made more formal by specifying "according to the Wikipedia page titled 'List of shopping malls in Singapore.'"
- "You can track my progress here." should provide explicit information on where or how the reader can track the progress unless it is intended to link somewhere.
- In "For this story, I collated the shop listings from 70 malls in Singapore." considering the AP style preference for numbers, it should remain as it is since it's the number 10 and above. However, ensure consistency across the document regarding the use of figures vs. spelled-out numbers based on context.
- Ensure hyperlinks are described more descriptively to enhance accessibility and provide context, for example, changing the text "here" in hyperlink descriptions to more descriptive phrases.
- In lists and tables, ensure that capitalization is consistent. For example, shop names in the table should follow a consistent format, either all uppercase or properly capitalized as per their official names.
- The phrase "This was surprising! It contradicts with the glitzy image of downtown Singapore we a familiar with now." should correct the typo to "...we are familiar with now."
- The claim "Bet you $5 you haven't heard of..." is informally phrased and betting terminology might not align with standard journalistic tone; consider rephrasing for a more neutral presentation.
- Address any missing commas in sentences for clarity, such as after introductory phrases or in complex sentences.
- Ensuring numbers are correctly formatted according to AP style, especially when referring to months, dates, or numerical data in the text.
- Verify the correct use of italicization for emphasis versus titles of works or foreign phrases, as AP style has specific rules about their usage.
- Reevaluate sentences that contain passive voice for potential conversion to active voice for clarity and engagement, keeping in mind this is a stylistic choice that may depend on context.
- Consider the use of "&nbsp;" for non-breaking spaces in HTML to control text wrapping, ensuring it's used appropriately and not excessively.
- Evaluate the consistency of verb tense throughout the article to maintain a cohesive narrative flow, especially in recounting past events or describing ongoing projects.
- Check for the correct spelling and AP style adherence in terms related to technology, data analysis, and geographical locations specific to the Singapore context, ensuring they are used accurately and consistently.
- Review the article's structure to ensure that headings are used hierarchically and appropriately, guiding readers through the content logically and intuitively.
