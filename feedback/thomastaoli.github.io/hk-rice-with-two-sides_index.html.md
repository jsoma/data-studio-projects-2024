## AP Style Feedback

- Replace "Feb 3, 2024" with "Feb. 3, 2024" for proper AP date formatting.
- Change "CBDs elsewhere in the world, food courts are always occupied" to "CBDs elsewhere, food courts are always occupied" for concise language.
- "Rice with two sides" should consistently either remain in quotes or be italicized (if considered a title) for consistency throughout.
- The phrase "like CBDs elsewhere in the world" should be simplified to "like CBDs elsewhere" to avoid redundancy.
- The currency conversion "HKD75 ($9.5)" should standardize the decimal to match formatting, e.g., "$9.50".
- The term "gweilo" should include a translation following AP guidelines on foreign words, consider adding "(foreigner)" after the term.
- Replace "鬼佬 ("gweilo", a White person)" with "鬼佬 (gweilo, meaning foreigner)" to correctly define the term rather than specifying "White person", improving cultural sensitivity and accuracy.
- Convert "HKD75 ($9.5)" to "75 Hong Kong dollars (about $9.50)" for clarity and consistency with AP style.
- "The past two years, however, have seen a drastic increase" should be specified with the exact years for clarity and accuracy, if known.
- "Rice with Two Sides" and similar phrases should maintain consistent capitalization throughout the document.
- The quotation “平靚正” should be followed by its English translation in quotes for reader clarity.
- For "COVID-19 pandemic", ensure consistency by using "coronavirus pandemic" or similar, depending on AP style updates.
- The term “拎走” should be followed by "(takeaway)" to provide clarity for readers unfamiliar with the language.
- Instead of "the “atas” areas of Hong Kong Island," use "the upscale areas of Hong Kong Island" for clarity and to avoid colloquialisms that international readers may not understand.
- "less than HKD30 ($3.8)" should be adjusted for consistent monetary representation, "$3.80".
- The description "sweet and sour pork, curry chicken, and braised pork knuckles" can be simplified by removing one example for succinctness.
- Ensure consistent use of double or single quotation marks for quotes and titles and align with AP Style preferences.
- The unfinished sentence "Well, I'm going to stop here and go for my dinner - probably the Rice with two sides leftove" should be completed, likely missing "leftovers."
- The term "OpenAI" should be clarified upon its first mention, with a brief explanation of what it is for readers who may not be familiar.
- The introductory "It's lunch time in Central" could specify "Central, Hong Kong" for global readership clarity.
- Remove duplicate font-size declaration in ".bottomleft" style, ensure CSS is concise and does not contain redundancies.
- The ellipsis in "After all, the fancy place like the one mentioned at the beginning is only a minority..." should be avoided in formal writing unless quoting or indicating an omission.
- Replace "I believe that the way Hong Kong people consume Rice with two sides will also become more sustainable." with a more objective tone, as personal belief statements should be avoided unless in direct quotes.
- "266 tons of disposable tableware" - specify if this is daily, monthly, or annual to clarify the statistic.
- In the "Note:" section, ensure that external links are described accurately, e.g., specifying that clicking will take readers to an external site, in line with AP guidelines on hyperlinking.
- "background video from Initium Media" should specify its relevance to the article for clarity on why it's included.
- The narrative shift in the closing "Well, I'm going to stop here and go for my dinner - probably the Rice with two sides leftover" seems informal; consider a more structured conclusion to maintain professional tone.
- "managed by 'Hong Kong Rice with two sides concern group' (香港兩餸飯關注組)" - the translation of the group name should be provided immediately after the foreign language term.
- Ensure that any Cantonese or Chinese phrases used throughout the article are immediately followed by an English translation for accessibility and adherence to AP guidelines on non-English terms.
- Check for consistency in the transliteration of Cantonese terms to ensure they adhere to a standard system understood by the majority of readers.
- For multimedia elements like the "Background video," clarify its connection to the article content, ensuring readers understand its relevance or contribution to the narrative.
