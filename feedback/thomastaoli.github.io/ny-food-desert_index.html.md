## AP Style Feedback

- Change "While city's policymakers" to "While the city's policymakers" for grammatical accuracy.
- Spell out "30" as "thirty" in "30 stores - according to Department of City Planning's latest report" to adhere to AP style for numbers under 10.
- In the sentence "In October 2023, Target announced the closure of its East Harlem store," reformat the date to follow AP style, changing "October 2023" to "Oct. 2023."
- Remove the quotation marks around the program name "Food Retail Expansion to Support Health (“FRESH”) program" and instead, capitalize it without quotes for consistency and clarity.
- Change “Coming to the middle of the Bronx I realized that I literally live in a food desert,” said local resident Roxie Martinez. to Roxie Martinez, a local resident, said, "Coming to the middle of the Bronx, I realized that I literally live in a food desert," for better flow and attribution according to AP style.
- Replace the italic tag in "<italic>Distribution of Major Grocery Chains in NYC</italic>" with em for correct HTML content formatting, though HTML editing was not requested, the visible misuse of tags for styling text necessitates correction for professional standards.
- Correct "37% lower than the citywide average in 2021." to "37 percent lower than the citywide average in 2021" because AP style spells out "percent."
- Revise "attributing to the excessive theft losses" to "attributing it to excessive theft losses" for grammatical accuracy.
- For the repetition under the last section, the paragraph "Furthermore, the closure of some retail outlets has..." is duplicated and should be removed to avoid redundancy.
- In the "Note:" section, change "Selected grocery stores include:" to "Selected grocery stores are" for clarity and conciseness.
- Revise "February 2024" to "Feb. 2024" to align with AP style for abbreviating months with specific dates.
- Rewrite "The health data was collected from the 2022 Community Health Profiles by New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene." to "The health data were collected from the 2022 Community Health Profiles by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene." for grammatical accuracy and specificity.
- Amend "Obesity rate is defined as the percentage of adults with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher." to "The obesity rate is defined as the percentage of adults with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher." for clarity.
- Update "© Thomas Li" to "Copyright (c) Thomas Li" for formal copyright declaration.
- In the date reference "Mar 4, 2024," change to "March 4, 2024," as AP style recommends spelling out March.
- Modify "said local resident Roxie Martinez" to "said Roxie Martinez, a local resident," for clearer attribution in quotes.
- Correct the inconsistent ampersand use in "Stop & Shop, Key Food, Morton Williams, Foodtown, Ctown, Westside Market, Union Market, H Mart, Gristedes, Food Baazar and ShopRite." by ensuring all conjunctions are consistent, replacing "&" with "and" within the list for consistency in non-titled entities as per AP style.
- For the subheadings styled in italic "<italic>Distribution of Major Grocery Chains in NYC</italic>" and the subsequent italicized section, consider changing to non-italicized as AP style generally does not favor the use of italics for emphasis.
- Remove the informal emojis from the title for a more professional tone as suited to New York Times standards.
