## AP Style Feedback

- Change "Feb 18, 2024" to "Feb. 18, 2024" for consistency with AP style date formatting.
- Remove the comma in "However, this is just the start of the Year of the Dragon in the zodiac cycle." 
- In the sentence starting with "While dragon is the only mythical...", "dragon" should be capitalized to "Dragon" as it refers to a specific zodiac sign.
- Change "Chap Goh Mei" to "Chap Goh Mei," as non-English terms should be followed by a comma when used in English sentences.
- Replace "even across North America" with "across North America as well" for smoother reading and to avoid beginning a sentence with "even."
- Change "it's almost distined" to "it's almost destined" to correct the typo.
- In "commented by a Chinese social media user," change to "a Chinese social media user commented" for active voice preference.
- The quotation “It a horrible idea...” should be corrected to “It's a horrible idea…” to add the missing contraction for "it is."
- Add a comma after "Indeed" in the sentence starting "Indeed, Dragon is used as a symbol..." for proper introductory phrase punctuation.
- In "NUS research," add "a" before "NUS" to improve readability ("according to a NUS research").
- Add a comma after "modern-day phenomenon" for clarity.
- Change "marks a shift of fertility culture" to "marks a shift in fertility culture."
- The word "even" in "even when government adjusted its policy measures" should be placed after "when" for clarity ("even when the government adjusted its policy measures").
- Replace "almost distined" with "almost destined" to correct the spelling mistake.
- Add a comma after "Accordingly" in "Accordingly, children born under this zodiac..."
- Correct "government-pushed" to "government-promoted" for clarity and accuracy.
- In the phrase "make their son becomes a dragon," change "becomes" to "become" to match subject-verb agreement.
- Change "it is still possible for people to have more children" to "people can still have more children" for conciseness and clarity.
- Correct "does not seem to be able to reverse" to "seems unable to reverse" for smoother readability.
- Change "which are among the lowest in the world" to "among the world's lowest" for conciseness.
- Insert a comma after "However" at the beginning of the paragraph for punctuation.
- Replace “$2557” with “$2,557” to match AP style for numbers.
- Change "government-led" to "government initiatives" for clarity and specificity.
- Insert a comma after "While" at the beginning of "While government-led efforts..."
- Correct "a user commented" to "commented a user" for consistent sentence structure.
- In "Babies born on the first day of the Year of Dragon," add "the" before "Year of Dragon."
- Remove the double quotation marks in the photo caption directly below "hospital.jpg" and use single quotes for 'Photo by Lee Women's Hospital'
- Lowercase "Note:" to match the AP style for subheadings within text.
- Add a comma after "which varies from the Gregorian calendar" for clarity.
- Change "Github" to "GitHub" to match the proper company naming.
- Replace “Back to my portfolio page” with “Return to my portfolio page” for a more formal tone.
- In the copyright notice, © should be spelled out as "Copyright" for clarity and to match style recommendations.
- Correct the typographical error from "distined" to "destined" in the sentence: "it's almost destined that their baby dragons are going to suffer from the larger cohort."
- Ensure all external links include "https://" for consistency and to guarantee they direct properly.
- Remove redundant "px" in "width:100%!important;" from the flourish-embed class for cleaner code presentation, although this falls slightly outside the direct text editing purview.
- Correct “CNY” to its full form "Chinese New Year" upon its first mention for clarity to all readers.
- Normalize the spacing around em dashes, e.g., "government-pushed—family planning programs," should not have spaces around the em dash if using it according to AP Style.
- For the HTML title tag "Data behind Hong Kong's "Rice with two sides" craze," correct to 'Data Behind Hong Kong’s “Rice With Two Sides” Craze' for title case and use smart quotes.
- Since AP style does not typically address HTML and CSS code directly, ensure written content within HTML follows AP style as closely as possible ignoring the stylistic code suggestions.
- Change any informal contractions such as "it's" to "it is" in formal texts for clarity and formality where applicable.
- Address any inconsistent use of quotation marks, ensuring direct quotes are in double quotes and indirect or alternative references in single quotes.
- Ensure that all references to specific years (e.g., "2024") are accompanied by relevant context to confirm their relevance to the text narrative without assuming future dates.
- Ensure scientific and statistical references are cited in a consistent format throughout the document to maintain professional and academic integrity, adhering to AP's citation style guidance.
- Maintain a consistent voice throughout the document, opting for either a direct or indirect narration style but not mixing the two without clear reason.
- When referring to public figures and their titles, ensure consistency and accuracy, particularly when naming officials and their respective offices, adhering to AP's guidelines for titles and official names.
- Verify that descriptions and captions of images accurately represent the content and context of the accompanying visual, ensuring that editorial standards for accuracy and clarity are upheld.
- Adjust any colloquial language to ensure the text's tone remains professional, authoritative, and accessible to a wide audience, following AP's guidance on language and tone for journalistic content.

Remember, while AP style provides a comprehensive framework for journalistic writing, exceptions may be necessary to meet specific editorial standards or when common usage varies from AP guidelines.
