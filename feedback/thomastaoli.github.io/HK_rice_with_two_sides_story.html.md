## AP Style Feedback

- Change "Feb 3, 2024" to "Feb. 3, 2024" for consistency with AP style dates.
- Replace "CBDs" with "central business districts" on first reference for clarity.
- Change "$9.5" to "$9.50" for consistency in financial figures.
- Remove quotation marks around Cantonese phrases and terms (e.g., “平靚正”) unless they are direct quotes.
- Change "Rice with Two Sides" to lowercase "rice with two sides" unless it's used as a title/name of a specific dish.
- Replace "US$3" with "$3" since the currency was previously defined in context.
- Spell out "two" in "Two ifc" if it’s the official name, clarify if abbreviation or stylization.
- Replace "the American consul" with "an American consul" unless specifying a particular individual known in context.
- Change "extended period (Rice with Two Sides is most commonly served as take-away, “拎走”)" to "extended period since rice with two sides is most commonly served as takeout" for clarity and to integrate the explanation naturally.
- Use figures for "266 tons" to ensure clarity and consistency in numerical representation.
- Replace "in 2020 alone, when the pandemic was the worst" with "in 2020, at the height of the pandemic" for clarity and precision.
- Change the incomplete sentence "Well, I'm going to stop here and go for my dinner - probably the Rice with two sides leftove" to complete the thought or clarify the statement for coherent ending.
- Correct "atas" to a more universally understandable term unless directly quoting or explaining the slang in context.
- Amend "a big portion of rice with two Cantonese sides for as low as US$3" to avoid the direct mention of price unless it's being analyzed or compared in the context for neutrality in reporting.
- For "garbage charges," provide clarification or context if referring to a specific policy or initiative (e.g., "the government's upcoming garbage charges initiative").
- Clarify "Rice with two sides has never been a fancy food - whether it was tasted by the American consul or not" by specifying if the reference to the American consul's tasting is hypothetical or factual.
- Change "the fancy place like the one mentioned at the beginning" to "fancier establishments such as the one mentioned earlier" for clarity and professionalism.
- Modify "the city has seen a resurgence of its staple dish" to "the city has witnessed a resurgence in popularity of its staple dish" for fluidity.
- Remove unnecessary quotation marks around web links or specify the text part of the link only for clarity and consistency with HTML content standards.
- Adjust "a two-meal rice set priced at HKD75 ($9.5)" to "a two-meal rice set priced at 75 Hong Kong dollars (approximately $9.50)" for clarity and consistency in currency representation.
- Specify "early this year" with the actual month or quarter for clarity on timing if not mentioned elsewhere closely preceding or following this reference.
- Remove dual font size specification in the style section for ".bottomleft" to maintain consistency.
- In consistency with AP style for numbers, change any instance of "two" referring to quantity to "2" if it's 10 or above, except in titles or names where it's stylized differently.
- Specify non-English terms upon first usage with translations to ensure clarity for all readers.
- Ensure that all Cantonese phrases are given context or translated to adhere to accessibility and clarity for a diverse readership.
