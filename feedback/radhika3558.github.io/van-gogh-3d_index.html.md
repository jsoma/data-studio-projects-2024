## AP Style Feedback

To enhance the provided HTML page text following the AP styleguide and ensure consistency and accuracy, here are specific suggestions:

1. **Title Editing**: "Bedroom in Arles: A 3D explainer of Van Gogh's masterpiece"
   - Change to "Bedroom in Arles: A 3D Explainer of Van Gogh’s Masterpiece."

2. **Name Capitalization**:
   - Ensure proper nouns such as "Yellow House," "Arles," "France," "Paul Gauguin," etc., are consistently capitalized.

3. **Date Format**:
   - "painted in 1888" is correct following AP style for historical dates.

4. **Numerals**:
   - Stick to spelling out numbers under 10 and use figures for numbers 10 and above, except when discussing ages.
   - "three versions of 'The Bedroom'" is correct, as numbers under 10 are spelled out.

5. **Quotation Marks for Titles**:
   - Correctly uses double quotation marks for the painting titles “The Bedroom” and “Bedroom in Arles.”

6. **Punctuation**:
   - Ensure commas and periods are placed within quotation marks, e.g., "The Bedroom," not "The Bedroom",.

7. **Links**: Ensure any hyperlinks are relevant and functional. Check all URLs for accuracy.

8. **Foreign Words**:
   - "Van Gogh moved into the 'Yellow House' in Arles, in the South of France." — “South of France” doesn’t require capitalization beyond "South" unless part of a proper noun or title.

9. **Abbreviations**:
   - Avoid unnecessary abbreviations. The text correctly uses names without excessive abbreviation.

10. **Credits and Attributions**:
    - Ensure image credits and attributions are consistent and correctly formatted. It's ideal to keep the styling uniform for all credits.
    - For image credits, consider "Vincent van Gogh/Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons" for consistency; however, this format must respect the specific licensing and attribution requirements.

11. **Consistency in Names**:
    - Ensure "Van Gogh," "Paul Gauguin," and other names are consistently spelled throughout the document.

12. **Accents on Names**:
    - If applicable and adhering to AP style modifications, ensure names like "Vincent van Gogh" do not use accents unless directly quoting a source where the accent appears.

13. **Cultural and Historical Accuracy**:
    - Verify cultural and historical references for accuracy, such as the description of the Yellow House and Van Gogh’s circumstances.

14. **Headings and Subheadings**:
    - Maintain a consistent format for headings and subheadings for readability.

15. **Bias-Free Language**:
    - The piece should avoid potentially biased language, ensuring neutrality and respect for subjects and audiences.

16. **Technical Accuracy**:
    - Confirm technical details regarding the methodologies of 3D modeling and any specific processes mentioned are correctly presented.

17. **Contact Information**:
    - Ensure the email address format in the "mailto" hyperlink uses a standard email format instead of "[at]".

18. **Accessibility**:
    - Add alt text for all images that accurately describe the picture for visually impaired readers. The current alt texts are good but can always be reviewed for descriptive accuracy.
