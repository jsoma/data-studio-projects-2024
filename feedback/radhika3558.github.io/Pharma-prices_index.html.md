## AP Style Feedback

Certainly, the provided content is a detailed and thorough piece focusing on the comparison of prescription drug prices between the US and other parts of the world. Below is a list of suggested edits, adhering to AP style guidelines, aimed at achieving consistency, accuracy, and clarity in the piece.

1. Capitalize "Fall" when referring to the semester to adhere to AP style's rules on academic terms (i.e., "Fall semester").
2. Convert the temperature unit to Fahrenheit when mentioning GERD to align with US standards (e.g., "acid reflux occurs when stomach acid flows back up into the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach (esophagus)." should specify the discomfort temperature range in Fahrenheit).
3. Use digits for numbers 10 and above; for instance, change "thirty capsules" to "30 capsules" to follow AP style guidelines on numerals.
4. In currency conversion, ensure that the currency symbol precedes the numerical value without spacing (e.g., "$9" instead of "$ 9").
5. Use "U.S." instead of "US" for consistency with AP style geographic abbreviations.
6. Ensure consistency in the spacing around en dashes and em dashes. AP style typically uses a space before and after en dashes (e.g., "India â€“ compared to the rates charged in the U.S.").
7. In the context of comparing drug prices, it's recommended to standardize the presentation of currency and units for clarity and easy comparison.
8. Ensure that all hyperlinks are relevant and operational, offering additional resources or references as needed.
9. When referring to a company or brand for the first time, it's recommended to use its full name followed by the abbreviation in parentheses if the abbreviation is used later in the text (e.g., "American Pharmaceutical Review (APR)" if "APR" is utilized subsequently).
10. Ensure accurate and respectful representation of health conditions, prescriptions, and treatments, keeping the language neutral and informative.
11. For quotations or data from studies, provide specific references or links for verification and further reading.
12. Review the permissions for images and graphics used within the content, ensuring proper attribution and legality of use.
13. Use "percent" instead of "%" in line with AP style guidelines (unless in tables or charts where space is limited).
14. When including multimedia elements like infographics or slideshows, provide descriptive captions for accessibility.
15. Final proofreading to catch any typographical, grammatical, or punctuation errors not specifically outlined above.

By addressing these elements, the piece will not only adhere closely to AP style guidelines but also enhance its readability, accuracy, and overall quality.
