## AP Style Feedback

- Replace "A quick look at the hats placed in front of performance" with "A quick look at the hats placed in front of performers".
- In "Shane Hill, a busker who regularly plays popular tunes on the saxophone at the station said he earns more through digital payments than in cash," add a comma after "station".
- Change "This is a result of the drastic decline in the number of cash payments made by consumers in the US." to "This shift reflects the drastic decline in the number of cash payments made by consumers in the US."
- For the section headers like "Cash payments are on the decline", consider using `<h2>` or `<h3>` tags for semantic HTML structure and easier navigation.
- Capitalize "Note and coin production in the US are near historic lows" to maintain consistency in subheadings' capitalization.
- Correct "During the same period, ATM fees have risen an average of 10 percent." to "During the same period, ATM fees rose by an average of 10 percent."
- Amend "A group of coin industry representatives also formed the U.S. Coin Task Force, which launched an investigation into the circulation challenge, and launched the #GetCoinMoving campaign." to "A group of coin industry representatives formed the U.S. Coin Task Force, which launched an investigation into the circulation challenge and initiated the #GetCoinMoving campaign."
- In the footer, replace "radhika.rukmangadhan[at]gmail.com" with "radhika.rukmangadhan@gmail.com" for clarity and to follow common email notation.
- Replace "padding: 0 0 125.5467% 0;" with "padding-bottom: 125.5467%;" in the CSS for the mobile artboard in the `#g-template-mobile` style to streamline the code.
- Ensure that the `<iframe>` tags for embedding charts have `title` attributes that provide a meaningful description of the embedded content for better accessibility.
- Add alt text for the image used in the header for better accessibility.
- Ensure all anchor tags (`<a>`), especially those navigating to social profiles or email, include `rel="noopener noreferrer"` when using `target="_blank"` to improve security.
- For the GitHub repository link in the footer, specify the type of content visitors can expect, such as "For code and methodology regarding this analysis, visit the [GitHub repository]." This adds clarity and context.
- Verify all external links to ensure they are correctly formatted and functional.
- Use the `<main>` tag to enclose the main content of the page for semantic HTML and improve accessibility.
- Place JavaScript links at the end of the body for better page loading performance.
- Update the `<html>` tag with a `lang` attribute if the page language is not English, e.g., `<html lang="en">` for English. This aids screen readers and other assistive technologies.
- Ensure CSS in `<style>` tags are minimized for production to improve page load speed. Tools like CSS Minifier can be used.
- Review the `alt` text for images to ensure they describe the image's content or function effectively for users who rely on screen readers.

These points aim to refine both the accessibility and technical structure of the HTML document, enhancing the user experience across different devices and connection types.
