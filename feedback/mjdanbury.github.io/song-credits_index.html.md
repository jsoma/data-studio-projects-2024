## AP Style Feedback

- In the subhead, correct the spelling of "innacurate" to "inaccurate".
- Remove the comma after "During each of these stages, artists" for clarity and flow.
- Change "Though these collaborators are rarely listed as primary artists, save for the occasional featured vocalist," to "Though these collaborators are rarely listed as primary artists—save for the occasional featured vocalist—" for correct punctuation.
- Capitalize "internet" in "With the advent of digital formats, online distribution platforms, and later streaming services, this certainty began to unravel."
- Add a comma after "digital listeners" for clarity in "For years now, digital listeners have had no sure-fire way to identify all the people who worked on the music they listen to."
- In "Even when accurate credit information does exist, there is no place on either platform for users to see all of an artist's collaborations all in one place," possessive "artist's" needs an apostrophe.
- Add a comma after "Since music artists tend to have extremely developed tastes in music themselves" for readability.
- Change "7 people (including Frank Ocean) as having worked on" to "seven people, including Frank Ocean, as having worked on" for consistency with AP style on numbers under 10.
- Correct the spelling of "mutliple" to "multiple" in "This includes multiple Grammy award-winning artists,".
- Insert a hyphen in "up-and-coming" in "up-and-coming alternative artists," for consistency.
- Change "As of March 2024, Spotify's song credits show 7 people" to "As of March 2024, Spotify's song credits show seven people" to adhere to AP style for numbers under 10.
- Replace "&amp;" with "and" in "The A&R (artists and repertoire) folks who work with the artists help insure accuracy, which is something we always strive for."
- In "the information that ends up there can often be dreadfully incomplete," consider revising to "the information that ends up there is often dreadfully incomplete" for clarity and to avoid ambiguity.
- In "Though major streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music have both taken the step of building a place for the song credits to go," consider replacing "Though" with "While" for better readability.
- Change "has the benefits of being free to browse, and aggregates all of an artists collaborations in a single page" to "has the benefits of being free to browse and aggregates all of an artist's collaborations in a single page"—needs an apostrophe for "artist's" and remove the comma for correctness.
- Capitalize "internet" in any instance where it appears as "internet" should be capitalized according to the latest AP style update when this guidance was provided.
- Alter "In the meantime, I stumbled upon a third-party service" to "In the meantime, I discovered a third-party service" for more formal tone.
- Change "...has the benefits of being free to browse, and aggregates..." to "...has the benefits of being free to browse and aggregates..." for correct punctuation (remove the comma before "and").
- In "...and old listeners alike would be able to discover new songs that resonated with someone they already listen to" change "listen to" to "listen to," for grammatical correctness.
