## AP Style Feedback

- Replace "coronavirus pandemic" with "COVID-19 pandemic" for specificity and consistency with AP style.
- Change "500 most frequent" to "500 most-frequent" to properly hyphenate a compound modifier.
- In the first paragraph under "Which Complaints Went Up?" delete "almost" before "unimaginable" for stronger statement.
- Change "the city" to "New York City" in the paragraph beginning with "By analyzing" for clarity and specificity.
- Replace "I have attempted to recreate" with "this examination attempts to recreate" for a more formal and objective tone.
- In the subhead, "The Traces That Our Pandemic Lives Left In New York City's 311 Data," capitalize "In" to adhere to title case.
- Change "pandemic shaped our lives in smaller ways too, ones almost unnoticed" to "pandemic also shaped our lives in subtle ways, often going unnoticed" for clarity and flow.
- Replace "for everything else" with "amid everything else" for better readability.
- Amend "traces. By analyzing" to "traces by analyzing" to create a smoother transition between sentences. 
- Change "weird little ways" to "various ways" for a more precise and neutral tone.
- Delete "almost" from "ones almost unnoticed" for a more definitive statement.
- Consider rephrasing "lived in the city through the pandemic" to "resided in New York City during the pandemic" for clarity and specificity.
- Replace "Which Complaints Went Up?" with "Which Complaints Increased?" for formal language.
- Replace "Which Complaints Went Down?" with "Which Complaints Decreased?" for formal language.
- Amend "Its unsurprising, people put off non-critical repairs so as not to have service teams enter their home." to "It's unsurprising that people deferred non-critical repairs to avoid having service teams enter their homes." for grammatical accuracy and clarity.
- In "With nobody out and about," replace "nobody" with "fewer people" for accuracy.
- Change "there were fewer people calling in complaints." to "the number of people calling in complaints dropped." for clarity and conciseness.
- Remove "TK- " from paragraphs that are placeholders to eliminate editorial notes.
- For all instances of "charts-up" and "charts-down" within img src attributes, ensure descriptions of visuals are provided for accessibility (though this directive is beyond textual changes, it aligns with AP's commitment to inclusivity and accuracy).
- The phrase "With nobody out and about, there were fewer people calling in complaints." could be more succinct and active: "With fewer people out and about, complaints decreased."
- Consider changing "helicopter noise" to "complaints about helicopter noise" in the subtitle for specificity.
- Amend "Dogs Off Leash" to "Off-Leash Dogs" for clarity and consistency in subtitle phrasing.
- Replace informal "here" with "on GitHub at this link" in the footer for more formal and clear direction.
- Ensure all date and time references, if present in any omitted paragraphs, follow AP style: spell out months when alone or with a year, abbreviate when with a specific date, and use figures for times, denoting a.m. or p.m.
- If any monetary figures are mentioned in omitted text, they should follow AP style: use the dollar sign and numerals, and for amounts of $1 million or more, use up to two decimal places.
- Verify that all numbers one through nine are written out and figures are used for 10 and above unless they start a sentence.
- Throughout, ensure percentages are expressed as numerals followed by the word "percent" (e.g., 50 percent).
- Confirm that all measurements are expressed in numerals followed by the word for the unit of measurement (e.g., 5 miles, 10 feet).
- For any legal references, use "v." for "versus" and ensure proper case names are italicized.
- If gender or racial terms are used, confirm they adhere to AP's guidelines on bias-free language.
- Ensure technology terms are used correctly and explained or defined where necessary for clarity.
- In direct quotes or paraphrases, verify that attributions are clear and the verb "said" is used for neutrality.
- Check for the consistent use of the serial comma in series of three or more items.
- If any acronyms or abbreviations are introduced, they should be spelled out at first mention with the abbreviation in parentheses if it will be used later in the text.
- Ensure all proper nouns, including names of specific programs, organizations, and geographical locations, are capitalized.
- Review the text for passive voice, which can be less engaging, and consider revising to active voice where appropriate (without altering quotes).
