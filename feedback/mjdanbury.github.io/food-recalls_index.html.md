## AP Style Feedback

- Change the title "Ingredient Households Have It Better" to ensure capitalization aligns with AP style: "Ingredient Households Have it Better."
- In the subhead, lowercase "at least" for consistency with AP style: "(at least when it comes to food recalls)."
- Correct the typo "definded" to "defined" in the paragraph discussing the Urban Dictionary posting.
- Ensure consistency in the use of single quotes or double quotes around 'Ingredient House' in the sentence mentioning the Urban Dictionary definition. AP style prefers double quotes for direct quotations and composition titles.
- The phrase "the first definition for 'Ingredient House' was posted to Urban Dictionary" should follow the AP style for dates, making it clear by rearranging or rephrasing for flow if needed.
- Adjust "In December 2021, the first definition for 'Ingredient House'..." to use a more specific date if possible, or clarify the time frame earlier in the month, in alignment with AP style for dates and times.
- There's redundant phrasing in "the great middle-American unifier burst out into the open of the collective consciousness." Consider simplifying to improve clarity and conciseness, although specific phrasing is subject to the reporter's style.
- In the same sentence, "middle-American" may not need to be hyphenated unless used as a compound adjective directly modifying a noun. Review and adjust the usage of "middle-American unifier" for AP style compliance.
- In the paragraph discussing the use of Colby-Jack cheese, consider specifying the nature of the videos more clearly for readers unfamiliar with the context. While AP style guidance focuses on concision and clarity, this suggestion aims to enhance reader understanding without contradicting the AP's principles.
- Correct "Trader Joes" to "Trader Joe's" to accurately reflect the brand name.
- The quotes around "Food manufacturers have a responsibility to ensure that the food they produce for the United States market is safe..." should be checked to ensure they are accurately transcribed from the source. AP style emphasizes accuracy in quotations.
- In the FDA quote, consider breaking the long sentence into shorter, clearer sentences or summarizing it for readability, while maintaining the original meaning. Long quotations can be challenging for readers, and AP style values clarity and brevity.
- Spell out acronyms at their first mention with the abbreviation in parentheses, ensuring readers are not confused. For example, "the Federal Drug Administration (FDA)" if this is its first mention.
- Lowercase "internet" when referring to it in general terms, in alignment with AP style updates.
- Use figures for numbers 10 and above in the narrative, ensuring consistency with AP style, such as when referring to the number of recalls or specific statistics related to food recalls.
- Rewrite passive voice for active voice where possible to enhance readability, a preference in AP style, e.g., "this reporter found that prepared food products were recalled..." could potentially be rephrased to actively denote the subject and action.
