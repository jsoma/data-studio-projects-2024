## AP Style Feedback

- Change "Non-Physcial" to "Non-Physical" in the title for correct spelling.
- Remove the quotation marks around "Karen" in the <h1> title element for consistency as it's used as a proper noun here.
- Alter the phrase "Karens seem to have taken the internet by storm with their outrageous antics." to avoid anthropomorphism by specifying who or what attributes these characteristics to "Karens."
- Replace “White American woman who is perceived as entitled or excessively demanding beyond the scope of what is considered to be normal behavior and decorum." with direct speech without quotation marks and attribute the source properly, since formal quotations from Wikipedia or other encyclopedias are not typically used in journalistic writing unless critically analyzed.
- Use numerals for the decades: change "1950s to 1960s" to "1950s-1960s" for consistency and clarity.
- Amend "These women have become middle-aged women in the past two decades." to clarify the timeline and avoid redundancy with "women... women."
- Change "The Karen meme first appeared in 2014, according to Know Your Meme." to "The Karen meme first appeared in 2014, according to Know Your Meme," removing the link and stating it as a source, given that external links in print journalism are not clickable and the AP style advises against phrases like "click here" or direct references to URLs.
- Change "“Middle-aged, middle-class white woman excessively attuned to small inconveniences and signs of disorder." to direct speech without quotation marks and attribute the City Journal properly.
- Modify the iframe HTML code comment to a more descriptive text that explains its presence and relevance without relying on visibility of HTML comments.
- In the sentence, "Characterized by their sense of entitlement and penchant for confrontation, Karens exhibit strikingly similar behaviors regardless of geographical location," specify a subject who does the characterization to avoid ambiguity.
- Replace "“All they see are open doors." with "All they see are open doors," removing the quotation marks for consistency as it isn't a direct quotation within the narrative flow.
- Change "My So-Karen Life." to "My So-Karen Life," removing the period inside the quotation marks in accordance with AP style for titles.
- Use numerals for measurements: change "two decades" to "20 years" for immediate clarity and conformity with AP style on numerals.
- Modify "Karens losing control should be more than a funny video we laugh about, and the structural problems underlie this phenomenon are worth looking into." to correct the grammatical structure and clarity, suggesting "The loss of control by 'Karens' should be viewed as more significant than humorous videos, and the underlying structural issues deserve investigation."
- Ensure all acronyms like "911" are clear to an international audience, possibly by adding "emergency services" in parentheses.
- Remove italicization from "<i>More quotes on the way...</i>" since AP style generally avoids the use of italics for emphasis, suggesting a clear statement such as "More quotes are forthcoming."
- Correct the casual tone found in segments like "we uncover not just moments of absurdity" to adhere to the objective tone of AP style, suggesting "the analysis reveals not only moments of absurdity."
- Update "societal norms, power differentials, and ingrained hierarchies." to avoid lists without clear conjunctions for better readability and AP style adherence.
- Ensure all references to digital or social phenomena explain or provide context for readers not familiar with terminology like "Karen," especially when used as a cultural reference point.
- Verify that the style of headlines and subheadings is consistent across the piece, ensuring each uses sentence case as per AP style unless referring to names or proper nouns.
