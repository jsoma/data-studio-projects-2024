## AP Style Feedback

- Replace “21st Century” with “21st century” to adhere to AP style guidelines on century capitalization.
- Change “August 2016” to “Aug. 2016” to conform to AP style abbreviations for months.
- Modify “100 were either from the United States or the United Kingdom” to “100 were from either the United States or the United Kingdom” for clarity in sentence structure.
- Update “How do Western critics select their greatest films?” to “How do western critics select their greatest films?” - AP style advises lowercase for directions and regions.
- Change “While it's challenging to compare the list to the entirety of film history” to “While it’s challenging to compare the list with all of film history” for clarity and conciseness.
- Correct “How US Critics Vote Differently From the Rest of the World” to “How U.S. Critics Vote Differently from the Rest of the World” for consistent country abbreviation and to lowercase “from” in titles as per AP style.
- Amend “significant influence on the global cinematic landscape” to “significant influence on the worldwide cinematic landscape” for AP style preference of “worldwide” over “global.”
- Revise “a clear trend of favoritism towards US films among US critics emerges” to “a clear trend of favoritism toward U.S. films among U.S. critics emerges” - “toward” rather than “towards” and U.S. abbreviation correction.
- Adjust “There has long been discrepancy of what's considered” to “There has long been a discrepancy over what’s considered” for grammatical accuracy and clarity.
- Correct the alt text in image tags to accurately describe the images. For example, change alt="US movies on the list" for the World-films.png to "World movies on the list."
- In the footer, replace “Data Journalist | Columbia University” with “Data Journalist, Columbia University” to comply with AP style’s preference for the comma in titles.
- The mention “Check out my code HERE” can be made more descriptive for clarity and accessibility. Suggest changing to “View the code for this project on GitHub.”
- Amend the iframe titles to be more descriptive for accessibility, e.g., update “Critics From the United States Tend to Vote for US Films” to include that it’s an interactive chart or analysis visualization.
- Change “BBC Film Project – Film Critics' Favorites” to “BBC Film Project: Film Critics’ Favorites” for consistent style in title punctuation and correct use of the possessive apostrophe.
- Correct “177 film critics” to “177 film critics,” ensuring numerical consistency with AP style which specifies using figures for numbers 10 and above.
- Update “The 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century is a list compiled in August 2016” to include the precise date if available or clarify if the exact date is not essential for the context.

Please note that without access to the full HTML code and structure, recommendations on improving accessibility via alt attributes, descriptive link texts, and semantic HTML are limited. Furthermore, some corrections assume the broader context which might not be provided in the excerpt.
