## AP Style Feedback

- Change "all-you-can-eat buffet restaurants are more than a deal for big-eaters" to "all-you-can-eat buffet restaurants offer more than deals for big eaters."
- Change "fixed prices, and an unlimited amount of food" to "fixed prices and an unlimited amount of food" to eliminate unnecessary comma.
- Change "It frees people from the worries of bills adding up and not getting a flexible portion." to "This frees people from worries about rising bills and inflexible portions."
- Replace "It brings customers the freedom to eat as much as they want, and get as many kinds of food as they like." with "Customers enjoy the freedom to eat as much as they desire and choose from a wide variety of foods."
- Remove the extra spaces before and after the paragraph within the `<div>` tags for consistency.
- In "2023 was a big year for buffet restaurants." specify the publication date or change to "This year has been significant for buffet restaurants."
- Remove the extra paragraph tags in "<p></p>In the past two decades," to correct the HTML syntax.
- Reword "the comeptition is getting more and more intense and goes beyond the food put onto plates." to avoid repetition and improve clarity: "competition has intensified, extending beyond the food served."
- In "A normal restaurant in Taiwan generally gets its gross profits at 50%, however for high-end buffet restaurants itâ€™s around 40%." replace "however" with "but," add a comma before "but," and adjust to comply with AP Style.
- Replace "it usually requires a huge venue in a central location," with "a central location and a large venue are typically required," for clarity and active voice.
- Alter "Hotels and event venue companies naturally have spacious venues for high-end buffet restaurants." to "Hotels and event venue companies usually provide the spacious venues needed for high-end buffet dining."
- Change "most well-performing buffets" to "most successful buffets" for conciseness.
- Replace the awkward phrasing "Buffet chains diversify their target market and make sure they win customers in different price levels and food types." with "Buffet chains cater to diverse customer bases across various price points and food types."
- Place a comma after "In Taiwan" and before "only three restaurant chains made it into the competition" for clarity and flow.
- Amend "Taiwanese people are undoubtely huge fans of Seafood and Japanese food!" to "Taiwanese people are undoubtedly big fans of seafood and Japanese cuisine." to correct spelling and AP style (lowercase "seafood").
- In "Bringing Fine-Dining Experience to All-You-Can-Eat: The Fanciest Buffet in Taiwan," ensure that "Fine-Dining Experience" and "All-You-Can-Eat" follow consistent capitalization rules for subtitles. Consider "Bringing Fine Dining Experience to All-You-Can-Eat: The Fanciest Buffet in Taiwan"
