## AP Style Feedback

- Change "all-you-can-eat buffet restaurants are more than a deal for big-eaters" to "all-you-can-eat buffets are more than deals for big eaters."
- In the sentence mentioning the expansion of Eatogether, abbreviate "7 more buffet restaurants over the existing 21 restaurants" to "seven more buffet restaurants over the existing 21."
- Change "2023 was a big year" to "2023 is a big year" to maintain present tense consistency.
- Correct typo "comeptition" to "competition" in the paragraph discussing the intensity of competition.
- In the paragraph beginning "High-end buffet is a tough business," change "it’s around 40%" to "it's about 40 percent."
- Modify "staffing up to 80 people" to "staffing for up to 80 people."
- In the phrase "accommodates 300 customers in each time slot," change "300" to "three hundred."
- Specify "NTD" as New Taiwan dollars on first reference for clarity.
- Change "$588 NTD (about 20 USD)" to "588 New Taiwan dollars (about $20)."
- Similarly, adjust "$4000 NTD (about 130 USD)" to "4,000 New Taiwan dollars (about $130)."
- Convert "2023" to "this year" when referencing the current date, according to AP style on avoiding future tense for events happening in the current year.
- Change "Located on the 86th floor of Taipei 101," to "Located on the 86th floor of Taipei 101," to remove redundancy.
- For the section titled "The Strategies of Buffet Chains," ensure restaurant names like "Eatogether" are consistently capitalized.
- Remove the redundant phrase "among all competitors" in the section discussing buffet chain strategies for simplification.
- Replace "Buffet Chains are among the highest-rated restaurants–it has been a success" with "Buffet chains rank among the highest-rated restaurants."
- Correct "Taiwanese people are undoubtely huge fans of Seafood and Japanese food!" to "Taiwanese people are undoubtedly huge fans of seafood and Japanese food!" for spelling and capitalization.
- In the footer, change "TKTKTK" to a placeholder text or remove if it's unintentional or incomplete.
- Ensure numbers used in a general sense, like in visitor capacities or expansions, follow AP style (spell out one through nine, use numerals for 10 and above).
- Verify the use of ampersands (&) and replace with "and" where appropriate for consistency with the AP style, unless part of a formal name.
- Check for consistent tense usage throughout the document to ensure present tense is used for current and ongoing events.
- Verify that embedded iframe elements like charts are accompanied by descriptive text for accessibility, even though this is outside the textual narrative.
- Clear up any unclear references to time, such as in the opening of "A Joy," to maintain temporal clarity ("in 2023" to "this year" if referring to an event occurring in the same year).
- Ensure URLs are hyperlinked appropriately if intended for web use, despite the instructions not to address HTML.
