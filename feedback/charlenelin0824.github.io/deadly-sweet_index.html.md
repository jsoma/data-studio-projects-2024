## AP Style Feedback

- In "When I began to feel homesick in New York City, I visited a bubble tea shop near campus to find a taste of home," remove "in" before "New York City" for consistency in geographical references.
- In "I ordered in a language I was not accustomed to speaking," change "in a language" to "a language" for conciseness.
- Change "冰塊甜度 (ice and sugar)?" to "冰塊甜度" (ice and sugar)?"" for consistency in punctuation within translations.
- Convert percentages to figures in "a typical boba with 'full sugar' in the US is 25% sweeter than that in Taiwan" and "the boba I received here was more than 10 times sweeter than what I was accustomed to" for clarity and AP style compliance.
- In "Comparisons: Is Everything American Just Sweeter?" change to "Comparisons: Is Everything in America Just Sweeter?" to maintain consistency in referring to the country.
- Change "It's common for international companies to tailor their products to suit local tastes" to "It is common for international companies to tailor their products to suit local tastes" for formality and clarity.
