## AP Style Feedback

- Change the title to "The Canceled Visa: What Has Shut Out Graduate Students from the Border" for capitalization consistency.
- Remove the period at the end of the subhead for stylistic consistency in headers/subheaders.
- In the text, spell out "over the last three months" to "In the past three months" for a more formal tone.
- Correct "a five-year-ban" to "a five-year ban" to eliminate the unnecessary hyphen.
- Change "visa canceled" to "visas canceled" to maintain subject-verb agreement in the paragraph discussing the actions of the Chinese students.
- Replace "in the US" with "in the U.S." for correct abbreviation of United States according to AP style.
- In "PhD program," capitalize "program" for consistency and formal tone as part of an official program name.
- Convert "more than a dozen PhD students from renowned colleges, including Yale and Johns Hopkins, have been denied re-entry to the country, with some facing a five-year-ban" to numerals "12 Ph.D. students" and "facing a five-year ban."
- Modify "President Proclamation 10043" to "Presidential Proclamation 10043" for accuracy.
- Change direct speech style in "The officer takes a box and locks your passport in it. 'Take this, go there and wait.'" to indirect to maintain a formal and consistent narrative style, or add quotation marks correctly to indicate direct speech.
- Correct "Everytime aboard is like a gamble" to "Every Time Aboard Is Like a Gamble" for headline-style capitalization and correct spacing in "Every time."
- For "10 hours," use figures for time as per AP style, keeping as is but ensure consistency across document regarding numeral usage.
- Amend "in half a month" to a specific time frame for clarity, if possible.
- Modify "Does airport matter" to "Does the Airport Matter" for consistency in title capitalization.
- Fix "transportation fee" to "transportation fees" for plurality consistency.
- Clarify "winter of 2023" and "March 2024" by ensuring there's no confusion in timeline or provide a more specific timeframe if discussing future events.
- For "STEM" and "non-STEM," consider defining STEM on its first use (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) and maintain consistency in the presentation of non-STEM (not capitalizing "non").
- Adjust "the U.S for graduate school" to "the U.S. for graduate school," adding the period after "U.S."
- In "the Chinese Embassy in the United States delivered a message that particularly pointed out Dulles International Airport," clarify the source and timing ("recently stated" or "issued a statement on [date]") for time-sensitive material.
- Replace cultural references such as "little dark room" with a neutral description if it could be misunderstood or lacks context for the reader.
- In "Do you need a translator," question marks should be used at the end of direct questions posed to the reader â€“ "Do You Need a Translator?".
- Correct "checking, you discover that you have been banned from entering the United States for five years" to present a clear timeline and alignment with factual accuracy regarding visa policies, if possible.
- Ensure all references to governmental and legal actions ("sign," "refuse to sign," visa cancellations, and bans) are accurately represented and consistent with AP guidelines on covering legal proceedings and immigration policies.
- The use of "sign" in interactive elements should be verified if it implies consent or acknowledgment of legal processes, ensuring clear and informed user engagement.
- Verify consistency in the portrayal of interactive choices ("Show sign," "Refuse to sign") to align with user interaction guidelines and clarity.
- For graphical elements and educational tools described (e.g., "img/conference.png"), ensure descriptions/captions are provided for accessibility and clarity, though not directly related to AP style.
