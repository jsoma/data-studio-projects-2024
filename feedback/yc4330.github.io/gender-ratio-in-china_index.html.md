## AP Style Feedback

Based on the AP style guide, the following edits are recommended for the text of the work provided:

- In the buttons labeled "Total," "first," "fourth," and "fifth and more," ensure consistency in capitalization. For example, change "first" to "First," "fourth" to "Fourth," and "fifth and more" to "Fifth and More" for proper capitalization in titles or headings.
  
- For the sentences mentioning numerical ranges, such as "102~107," it is more common in AP style to see this written out with the word "to," changing it to "102 to 107" for clearer understanding.
  
- In the sentence "If only 100 babies are born in a district, it is conceivable that there will be a large accidental error," consider specifying the unit early to maintain clarity, like "If in a district only 100 babies are born, it is conceivable that there will be a large accidental error."
  
- The referencing of figures and data should follow a more formal citation style, even though the AP style is more focused on journalistic writing. For example, it would be beneficial to introduce a source inline more formally when you first mention the 2020 China Census data, like "According to data from the 2020 China Census..."

- The phrase “Without the sample size given, these numbers can't tell us anything!” could be made more formal for written reports: "Without given sample sizes, these numbers are not informative."
  
- The phrase "Finally, it is worth noting..." could start a new paragraph to enhance readability and coherence of ideas.
  
- In the context of explaining probability, it might be more accurate to rephrase for clarity: "For the same reason, having already had a baby girl does not increase the chances of having a baby boy next."
  
- The footer content that says "You can find the Github Repo for this project here." might be made more formal and clear: "The GitHub repository for this project is available here."
  
- Ensure that the source cited at the end, "China Census 2020," follows a consistent format for citing sources, perhaps integrating it more formally with a statement like, "Data Source: National Bureau of Statistics of China, 2020 Census."
  
- "Or, some baby girls are not reached by the census." This sentence starts abruptly with "Or," You might consider integrating it into the previous sentence for better flow: "...selective births, or due to some baby girls not being accounted for in the census."
