## AP Style Feedback

- Amend "siginificant" typo to "significant" in the paragraph about the milestone for gay rights movements.
- Correct "same sex couples" to "same-sex couples" for consistency with hyphenation rules.
- Replace double "I" in "As a LGBTQ ally, I Iooked into disinformation data..." with a single "I".
- Standardize date format from "2017-10-06" to "Oct. 6, 2017," following AP style guidelines for dates.

- Capitalize "Constitutional Court" and "Civil Code" when referring to specific legal entities and documents in Taiwan.
- In "2018 referendum remains the most politically engaged referendum," change "2018" to "The 2018" for grammatical correctness.
- Correct "researhes" to "researches" in Austin Wang's quote for correct spelling.
- Change "opnion" to "opinion" in Austin Wang's quote for correct spelling.
- Ensure consistency in the formatting of percentage, as in "67%," by surrounding with spaces or connecting directly to numbers following AP style, depending on previous usage in the document.
- Amend "database from Cofacts--a collaborative fact-checking platform" to "database from Cofacts â€” a collaborative fact-checking platform" for correct dash usage.
- Change "filter the messages down to ones that are recorded in 2018" to "filtered the messages down to those recorded in 2018" for grammatical consistency.
- In the bullet list under "Here's what I found:", ensure all items are complete sentences or reformat to avoid sentence fragments for clarity and consistency.
- Rewrite "It has a database of potential disinformation messages and their fact-checking results." to "It maintains a database..." for clarity and active voice.
- Correct "vetoed" to "rejected," if that is the more accurate term in the context of the referendum outcomes.
- Change "It was a siginificant milestone for gay rights movements, but the journey to achieve this had been a rocky one." to address redundancy; consider simplifying to maintain focus and avoid repetition.
- Consider rephrasing "to exitinction!" for clarity and factual accuracy, unless directly quoting disinformation.
- Adjust the casual tone in "What???!!" to ensure professionalism and neutrality, especially if quoting from sources or messages directly.
- In the mention of Cher Wang, specify her role at HTC more clearly (e.g., "co-founder and chair") for accuracy and clarity.

- Ensure hyperlinks to sources like Cofacts are presented consistently and accurately, including a verification of the URL for accessibility.
