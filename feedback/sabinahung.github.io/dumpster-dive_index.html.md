## AP Style Feedback

- Replace "Keelong" with "Keelung" for correct spelling of the city name.
- Change "cats per household" to "cats per household on average" for clarity in the statement about pet registration data in 2023.
- Change "Pintong" to "Pingtung" for the correct spelling of the county name.
- In the list of cities/counties with the highest number of cats per household, replace the colon with a comma and insert "with an average of" before the number of cats for clarity and consistency (e.g., "Keelung, with an average of 8.41 cats per household").
- Use figures for all dates consistently (e.g., 2023 should remain as is, ensuring numerical representation of years throughout).
- Ensure that punctuation, such as periods and commas, are placed outside of hyperlink tags for proper structure.
- Titles should be in quotation marks if they refer to articles, reports, or documents (e.g., the pet registration data report might need quotation marks if it's a titled document).
- Add a period after "Pintong: 6.28 cats per household" to maintain consistency in list punctuation.
- Ensure hyperlinks are descriptive and not just "here" for better readability and accessibility (e.g., "You can find my code and data on GitHub").
- Abbreviations and acronyms should be spelled out on first mention with the abbreviation in parentheses if used later in the document (This doesn't directly apply here but is a good practice to check for missing instances).
- Ensure that numerals are used for measurements to maintain consistency (e.g., numbers of cats per household are correctly used).
- Verify city and county names for typographical errors to ensure accuracy and professionalism in reporting.
- Spell out the word "percent" instead of using the symbol "%" unless in graphs or charts (not directly applicable here but good to remember).
- Use "a.m." and "p.m." with periods and lowercase letters for times, ensuring consistency across the document (not directly applicable here but good to remember for event times or other time references).
- Ensure capitalization consistency, especially with proper nouns and formal titles (e.g., titles before names are correctly capitalized).
- Ensure that serial commas are used in a series for clarity (not directly applicable here but good to check in lists or series).
- Check for the use of biased language and aim for neutrality and inclusivity in reporting (No instances found here, but always good to check).
- Verify the correct use of italics for titles of books, movies, etc., and quotations for article titles or specific references within the text (Not directly applicable here but useful for consistency in referencing works).
- Ensure that the date formats follow AP style, typically "Month Day, Year" with the months Jan., Feb., Aug., Sept., Oct., Nov., and Dec. abbreviated when used with a specific date (not directly applicable here but useful for date references).
