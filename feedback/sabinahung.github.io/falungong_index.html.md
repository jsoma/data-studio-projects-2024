## AP Style Feedback

- Change the title from "Everything, Everywhere, All about Anti-China Politics" to "Exploring the Realm of Anti-China Politics" for clarity and conciseness.
- Amend the phrase "More often than not–Falun Gong, a spiritual martial arts group that fled to Western countries after being banned by China in 1999, appears in many forms around you" to "Falun Gong, a spiritual martial arts group banned by China in 1999, is frequently encountered in various forms."
- In the paragraph beginning with "Falun Gong began as a spiritual martial arts group," change "Millions of people in China were practicing Falun Gong in the 1990s" to "Millions of Chinese practiced Falun Gong in the 1990s" for clarity and conciseness.
- Modify "the Communist Party’s attention" to "the attention of the Communist Party" for clarity.
- Update "After 20 years of crackdown" to "After two decades of suppression" for a more formal tone.
- Replace "there is Shen Yun, their performing arts group; there is the Epoch Times, Falun Gong-backed newspaper; New Tang Dynasty TV, their broadcast channel; and lastly, Falun Dafa where they promote this spiritual practice" with "these include Shen Yun, a performing arts group; The Epoch Times, a newspaper; New Tang Dynasty TV, a broadcast channel; and Falun Dafa, which promotes this spiritual practice" for conciseness.
- In "However, the Epoch Times has been reported to become partisan since Trump’s administration," change "However" to "Additionally," to maintain a neutral tone and correct the logic flow.
- Change "Trump as an anti-Chinese Communist ally" to "Trump as an ally against the Chinese Communist Party" for accuracy and clarity.
- Change "Starting from 2016, the Epoch Times saw" to "Beginning in 2016, The Epoch Times viewed" for clarity and consistency with AP style date references.
- Amend "it has also been found to be one of the top promoters of a baseless conspiracy theory" to "it has been identified as a major promoter of a baseless conspiracy theory" for conciseness and clarity.
- In the sentence starting with "Today, the fast growth of the Epoch Times," consider changing "fast growth" to "rapid expansion" for a more formal tone.
- Replace the use of "--" in "They are in fact all run by this Chinese spiritual group--Falun Gong" with a comma for proper punctuation.
- Correct the inconsistent usage of "the Epoch Times" to ensure it is consistently capitalized as "The Epoch Times" throughout the document for consistency with the publication's proper name.
- For dates and numerical references, ensure consistency by adhering to AP style, such as changing "$30M" and similar notations in the figure captions to "30 million dollars" where text discussions around these numbers occur for clarity and consistency with AP style guidelines.
- Ensure all linked texts are clearly described for accessibility, replacing generic phrases like "here" in "You can find the code and data here" with specific descriptions, e.g., "View the code and data for this analysis on GitHub."
- Finally, ensure all images and multimedia have clear, descriptive alt texts for accessibility, such as adding succinct, descriptive alt text to all <img> tags missing it.

This list focuses on improving clarity, adherence to AP style, and ensuring the text is accessible and professionally presented.
