# Feedback for [Has Taiwan become a cat state?](https://sabinahung.github.io/pet-ownership-taiwan/)

## AP Style Feedback

- Change "Has Taiwan become a cat state?" to "Has Taiwan Become a Cat State?" to adhere to AP style title capitalization.
- In the subheading "An overview of the pet ownership data in Taiwan," capitalize "Overview," "Pet," "Ownership," "Data," and "Taiwan" for consistency with title case in headings.
- Replace “weren’t” with "were not" for a more formal tone and clarity.
- Change "the past decade" to "the past 10 years" for numerical consistency per AP style.
- In "as of 2021," add a comma after "2021," for proper date punctuation.
- The cities/counties "Keelong," "Nantou," and "Pintong" should be corrected to their proper spellings "Keelung," "Nantou," and "Pingtung" for accuracy.
- Replace "8.41 cats per household" with "8.41 cats per household on average" for clarity. Apply this change to each list item regarding cats per household.
- Amend "Surprisingly, we saw some overlaps between" to "Surprisingly, there were some overlaps between" for a more objective tone.
- Change "registered the most dogs" to "had the highest dog registrations" for clarity and to avoid passive voice.
- Alter "registered the most cats" to "had the highest cat registrations" for consistency and clarity.
- In the statement "Perhaps it's no longer an either-or between cats and dogs but a mix of both?" revise to "Perhaps it is no longer a choice between cats or dogs but a mix of both?" for formality and clarity.
- The phrase “You can find my code and data here” should specify what "here" refers to more clearly, e.g., "You can find my code and data on GitHub at this link" for precision and clarity.
- Remove emoji usage from the byline for professionalism and consistency with AP style.
- When mentioning "2023," confirm that this is a forward-looking statement or if it should be adjusted to past tense, depending on the publication date.
- For numbers like "8.41 cats per household," ensure that using figures instead of spelling out the numbers aligns with AP styleguidance for precision in data reporting.
- Verify the use of hyperlinks for adherence to AP style, ensuring the text linked is descriptive of the target content, e.g., "Ministry of Agriculture in Taiwan’s data on pet ownership" instead of generic "here" links.
- Ensure that foreign place names like "Taiwan," "Keelung," "Nantou," and "Pingtung" follow AP style guidelines for international geographic names.
