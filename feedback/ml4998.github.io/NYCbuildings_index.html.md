## AP Style Feedback

- Correct the spelling of "architecture" in the `<title>` tag from "NYC arcitecture" to "NYC Architecture".
- In the headline within the `<h1>` tag, change "New York City's Architectural Marvels: A Geek's Odyssey through the Concrete Jungle" to use sentence case: "New York City's architectural marvels: A geek's odyssey through the concrete jungle".
- In the first paragraph, correct the hyphenation in "New-Yorkers" to "New Yorkers".
- Also, in the first paragraph, replace "duh!" with a more professional expression or remove it for clarity and tone consistency.
- Remove the comma before "in fact" in the first paragraph as it's not needed per AP style.
- Change "Pro-tip:" to "Pro tip:" in the first paragraph to remove the hyphen.
- Change "1. The Statue of Liberty" to "The Statue of Liberty" and remove the number. When listing items, avoid using numbers unless the sequence is critical to the content.
- In the section about the Statue of Liberty, correct "brown-ish" to "brownish" for consistency with AP style spellings of color descriptions.
- Correct "35 years. However," to "35 years, however," by replacing the period with a comma for proper compound sentence structure.
- Change "600 bolts of lightning." to "600 lightning strikes." for clarity and accuracy in description.
- Adjust "Nestled by the concrete shore of the fifth avenue" to "Nestled by the concrete shore of Fifth Avenue" by capitalizing "Fifth".
- Correct "a a spiral-ramped open space" by removing the duplicate "a" in the description of the Guggenheim Museum.
- Change "it's prone do dirt" to "it's prone to dirt" for grammatical accuracy in the description of the Guggenheim Museum.
- Amend "Both Wright and Guggenheim passed before the museum even opened." to "Both Wright and Guggenheim died before the museum opened." for clarity and respectfulness.
- For accuracy and consistency, ensure all referenced websites, like in the hyperlink about Lady Liberty being hit by lightning bolts, are checked for credibility and presented in a consistent format, though this specific validation goes beyond copy editing per instructions.
- Lastly, ensure all external links (e.g., the GitHub project page at the end) are correct, functional, and follow AP guidelines for digital content.
