## AP Style Feedback

- Change "(Especially when New Yorkers are Chicagoans are in the same room)" to "(especially when New Yorkers and Chicagoans are in the same room)" to correct grammatical errors and lowercase the word "especially" for consistency within a sentence.
- Change "midwestern" to "Midwestern" to correctly capitalize the geographical reference.
- Replace “Sicilian is the most popular pizza ordered across the states with 10 states picking this” with “Sicilian pizza ranks as the most popular, chosen by 10 states, including” for clarity and to avoid ending a sentence with a preposition.
- Change “new Mexico” to “New Mexico” to correct the capitalization of the state name.
- Replace “1. Sicilian” with “First, Sicilian” to adhere to AP style guidelines that recommend spelling out numbers one through nine.
- Change “2. The next one on the list is” to “Second, the Chicago style Deep Dish Pizza” to maintain consistency with AP style for enumerating items in a text.
- Capitalize “deep dish” so it reads “Chicago style Deep Dish Pizza” to maintain consistency when referencing specific pizza styles.
- In the sentence mentioning deep dish pizza, change “in other words something that a lot of midwesterners especially native Chicagoans would absolutely go to war for!” to “is something many Midwesterners, particularly native Chicagoans, highly value.” to maintain objective tone and precision.
- Replace “3. The third most popular type is Supreme” with “Third, the most popular type is Supreme,” aligning with AP style for using words instead of numerals for counting.
- Correct the inconsistency in pizza name styling by changing “Supreme” to consistently have either capitalization for the type or not, depending on the convention used for pizza names throughout the article.
- Amend “as well is Wyoming” to “as well as Wyoming” to correct the grammatical structure.
- For the phrase "This delight— fluffy, spongy bread base topped with a meatless sauce made from tomatoes, onions, herbs, and anchovies is also favored by states such as Florida," correct the punctuation to "This delight — a fluffy, spongy bread base topped with a meatless sauce made from tomatoes, onions, herbs, and anchovies — is also favored by states such as Florida," for clearer sentence structure.
- Change “To find my CSV files and data, visit my GitHub profile” to “For my CSV files and data, visit my GitHub profile,” for a more direct instruction.
- Adjust "or in other words something that a lot of midwesterners especially native Chicagoans would absolutely go to war for!" to remove the colloquial phrase "go to war for," replacing it with "value deeply," to maintain a professional tone.
- Correct the inconsistency in pizza descriptions by ensuring all pizza types are introduced with consistent formatting; for instance, "Supreme" is preceded by its popularity ranking without a numbered list, unlike the first two types.
