## AP Style Feedback

- Change the title to capitalize "Why Are Lesbian Bars Closing?" for consistency with title case standards.
- In the subtitle, correct "NYC a well as" to "NYC as well as" for grammatical accuracy and clarity.
- Change "lGBTQ+" to "LGBTQ+" to ensure proper capitalization of the acronym.
- In the second paragraph, correct "marginzalized" to "marginalized" for correct spelling.
- Specify the numerical value "3" in words as "three" in the context of "Henrietta Hudson is one of 3 lesbian bars in New York" to follow AP style for numbers nine and under in text.
- Correct "patreon" to "patron" in contexts where it is used to mean a customer or supporter of the bars, as "patron" is the correct term and "Patreon" is a specific platform for online creators.
- Add commas to large numbers for readability, changing "about 200 lesbian bars" to "about 200 lesbian bars".
- In the expression "COVID-19 but also claims to be on the most visited," insert "one of" before "the most visited" for clarity and accuracy in the sentence about Henrietta Hudson.
- Adjust the phrasing "in the 1980s, there were about 200 lesbian bars, whereas, as of 2024, the number is down to about 32" to maintain consistent tense, considering the use of present tense earlier in the article.
- Correct "a queer filmmaker who launched the Lesbian Bar Project" by ensuring that "Lesbian Bar Project" is properly introduced or explained if it hasn't been previously mentioned for clarity.
- Consider revising the phrase "the history of lesbian spaces in the country is riddled with many ups and downs" for potential ambiguity; specify "the United States" if that is the intended reference to avoid assuming readership location.
- For consistency and formality, ensure all instances of "lesbian bars" maintain the same level of capitalization unless referencing a proper noun, such as a project or organization name.
- Use "New York City" instead of "New York" when referring to the city for clarity, as "New York" could also refer to the state.
- Replace “a lot” with “many” in “A lot of us grew up in environments where we didn’t even have anything close to what Hens or Cubby is” for more formal language as preferred in journalism.
- Correct typographical error “lGBTQ+ spaces” to “LGBTQ+ spaces” to ensure proper capitalization of the acronym.
- In the statement "There are currently 32 lesbian bars in the U.S," specify if "currently" refers to the publication year or another specific year for clarity.
- In references to people, such as "Nina Dvali, a Henrietta Hudson patreon," ensure that titles and affiliations are accurate and consistently presented.
- Clarify abbreviations or jargon on first usage unless widely known by the general readership; for example, define "LGBTQ+" if the audience might not be familiar with the term.
- Ensure direct quotes are attributed in a way that doesn't disrupt readability, while maintaining the speaker's original voice.
- Replace casual language or colloquialisms with more formal phrasing where appropriate to maintain the article's professional tone.
