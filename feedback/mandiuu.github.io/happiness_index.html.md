## AP Style Feedback

- Change the title tag to capitalize all major words: "Shiny Happy People" to "Shiny Happy People".
- In the byline, remove the emoji next to the author's name: "Carla Mandiola"ðŸ˜— to "Carla Mandiola".
- Spell out the year "2012" in the paragraph discussing the creation of the World Happiness Report.
- Change "GDP per capita" to "GDP Per Capita" to maintain consistency in the capitalization of titles and subtitles within the content.
- The phrase "corruption widespread" should be corrected for grammatical consistency: "Corruption Perception: If corruption is widespread throughout the government or within businesses."
- In the list of categories, ensure consistency by adding a colon after each item: "GDP per capita:".
- The phrase "This are" should be corrected to "These are" in both instances it appears.
- The contraction "can't" should be changed to "cannot" for a more formal tone: "Money cannot buy everything".
- Add a comma after "For example" for clarity: "And for example, cultivating gratitude in everyday life contributes to our wellbeing".
- Change "choosen" to "chosen" for correct spelling in "Something must be working because for seven years Finland has been chosen the most happy country in the World Happiness Report."
- The quotation marks around "Freedom" and the punctuation inside the quotation in the sentence discussing freedom should follow AP style: "'Freedom' is the category that counts the average of the responses to the question, 'Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?'"
- Ensure consistency in list formatting by adding periods after each country listed in both the happiness comparison and social support sections.
- Change the spelling from "behaviour" to "behavior" if used (not present in the given text but relevant for AP style).
- Ensure number usage adheres to AP style, specifically spell out numbers one through nine unless they convey specific measurements, dates, ages, etc.
- For currency, use "$" symbol with figures without decimal points unless cents are involved: Change any instance of "dollars" without a specific number to a numeral followed by "dollars" if under a million.
- Correct the informal phrase "a lot" to "many" or "much" depending on the context if needed (not explicitly found in the text but common in informal writing).
- Replace the use of "&" with "and" in textual content for professionalism unless it is part of a companyâ€™s official name.
- Ensure that all hyperlinks are described meaningfully instead of "click here" or similar phrases.
- Verify that quotes and paraphrases correctly attribute opinions and information to the right sources, following "said" with the subject's designation where applicable: "Tomas Rau, an economist and Research Fellow of the IZA Institute of Labor Economics, said".
- The sentence "Basic needs are essential for happiness, and when these needs are unmet, individuals become unhappy." could be more precise. For instance, if discussing specific research findings, it could be attributed directly: "According to [Name], basic needs..."
- Make sure that metric and imperial measurements are provided where relevant for an international audience, especially in data-heavy articles, although not explicitly mentioned here.
- Lastly, ensure all external links open in a new tab with appropriate HTML attributes for usability, though this falls slightly outside of pure copyediting as per the given instructions.
