## AP Style Feedback

- Change "borned" to "born" to correct the verb form in the sentence: "This is the story of a baby born in Italy in September 2022."
- In the phrase "20 months old, and 50%," remove the comma after "old" for proper punctuation: "He is now 20 months old and 50% of his life has been in the US."
- Use "percent" instead of the symbol "%" following AP style for non-technical content: "...and 50 percent of his life has been in the US."
- In the list "boat, car and dog," add a serial comma before "and": "...in English, like boat, car, and dog."
- Spell out "3D" as "three-dimensional" in text according to AP preferences when not in a title or header for clarity: "Loads three-dimensional model viewers..."
- In the description, "The baby doesn't know that this is a Pokemon," capitalize "Pokemon" consistently: "The baby doesn't know that this is a Pokémon."
- Remove the apostrophe in "dad's friend" to adhere to AP style of avoiding possessives when possible: "This is a gift from his dad friend."
- The phrase "a plush toy of Fuecoco, a Pokemon that no one in the house knows but the baby loves," needs rephrasing for clarity: "a plush toy of Fuecoco, a Pokémon unknown to the others in the house but beloved by the baby."
- Use figures for ages according to AP style: "He is now twenty months old..." should remain as "He is now 20 months old..."
- Adjust "in the US" to read "in the U.S." for consistency with AP abbreviations: "...has been in the U.S."
- "The best sign that a toy is a favorite is that it is damaged." Consider revising for clarity, though technically correct, it could be misinterpreted: "Evidence of a toy's favoritism often includes signs of wear."
- The phrase "The  wooden hedgehog is holding up, but the plastic ball" contains an extra space between "The" and "wooden."
- In the context of a webpage, consider specifying the nature of links for clarity per AP's guidance on digital content—though AP specific guidance on hyperlink text isn't provided, clarity is always key in digital communications.
- In the instruction "View in your space," consider whether instructions for engagement with digital elements should be more descriptive per AP's general clarity and user engagement principles.
- "It's a plush toy of Fuecoco, a Pokemon" should address Pokémon with the accent: "...a Pokémon..."
- Ensure "Fuecoco is soft but can resist the baby's strength" aligns with intended meaning; it's clear, but verifying the exactness for technical accuracy falls outside AP's scope yet remains crucial.
- "This palla is giving it all to avoid breaking completely." might need clarification or rewording for smoother readability, given its metaphorical flourish isn't a typical concern for AP but general editorial advice.
- "He likes to grab and throw it around; Fuecoco is soft but can resist the baby's strength." Consider breaking into separate sentences for clarity and impact.
- Lastly, consider a final review to ensure all elements promotional or directive in nature ("Look at my playful code here.") are in line with AP's guidelines on promotional content and clarity in digital call-to-actions.
