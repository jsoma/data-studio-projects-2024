## AP Style Feedback

- Change the article's title to remove special characters: from "âœ¨All that glitters is not gold: the downfall of trying to use NY Dataâœ¨" to "All That Glitters Is Not Gold: The Downfall of Trying to Use NY Data."
- Correct the inconsistent capitalization in the term "NYC Data" to ensure it's uniformly capitalized throughout the text.
- Correct the initial date format "November 21, 2023," to "Nov. 21, 2023."
- Modify "57.582 rows" to "57,582 rows" to adhere to the proper thousand separator.
- Change "more than 290.000 times" to "more than 290,000 times" for consistency with the AP style numeric format.
- The phrase "OKAY, THAT'S NOT OKAY." should be rephrased for a more formal tone and consistency with journalistic standards.
- Replace the informal phrase "OKAY, THAT'S NOT OKAY." with a sentence that fits the journalistic tone, such as "This discrepancy is concerning."
- Adjust "I felt like the luckiest girl in the world." to remove subjective language, suggesting a more neutral tone.
- Rewrite "I wouldn't." to provide clarity and context, as its abruptness may confuse readers.
- Replace "people no longer wanted to name their children 'Carla.'" with "the popularity of the name 'Carla' may have declined," for a more objective tone.
- Correct "since 1926 of people borned in the United States" to "since 1926 of people born in the United States" to correct verb tense and grammar.
- Ensure all embedded iframe elements have descriptive titles and ARIA labels for accessibility, verifying current text meets guidelines. If not, recommend improvements.
- Amend "in life, you have to know when to stop and when to give up," to a less conversational tone, such as "It's important to recognize when to reassess one's approach."
- Update "a database downloaded more than 290 thousand times is incorrect." to "a database downloaded over 290,000 times contains inaccuracies," for numerical formatting and clarity.
- Alter "the same person who created the ggplot2 and tidyverse packages" to attribute professional titles or clarify the person's role for context.
- The phrase "if this is not a sign, what is?" should be revised to fit the objective tone of reporting.
- Change "Thanks to him," to "Thanks to this discovery," to maintain focus on the action rather than the individual.
- For numbers, ensure consistency with AP style, particularly when switching between figures and words for similar categories within the text.
- Review all hyperlinks to ensure they open in the same tab for consistency (remove "target='_new'") unless editorial guidelines dictate otherwise for external links.
- Replace "I sent an email asking for it to the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene," with "I requested the dataset from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene via email," for clarity and active voice.
- Eliminate redundant phrases like "trying and falling and trying again" to "attempting" for conciseness.
- Adjust "The moral of this story: never unquestioningly believe in databases, test them until you get bored," to "The takeaway: always verify databases rigorously," for professionalism and clarity.
- Replace conversational elements and emojis, such as "ðŸ™ƒ," with text that maintains the piece's informative and neutral tone.
- Ensure consistency in the presentation of data figures, choosing either to spell out the numbers (following AP style for numbers one through nine) or use numerals consistently for clarity and professionalism.
- Correct "compiled all the names since 1926 of people borned in the United States" by changing "borned" to "born" for grammatical accuracy.
- Revise "in many aspects:" to "in several aspects, including:" for clarity before listing.
- Correct the spelling of "birthed" to "birth" in the context of compiling names.
- Throughout the piece, maintain a consistent and professional tone by avoiding overly casual language and personal anecdotes that may detract from the objective analysis of data.
- Ensure that claims about database inaccuracies are presented with evidence or examples to maintain credibility and adherence to journalistic standards.
- Verify that all statistical claims, such as the number of downloads or specific data findings, are presented clearly and precisely, with explicit mention of the source or methodology when necessary for transparency.
