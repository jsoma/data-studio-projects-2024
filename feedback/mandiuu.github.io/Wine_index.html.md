## AP Style Feedback

- Change "Tell me WINE üç∑" to "Tell Me Wine" to maintain consistency with AP style rules on capitalization and to avoid using emojis in titles.
- Amend "The journey of a Chilean woman discovering wine in NYC" to "A Chilean woman's journey discovering wine in NYC" for smoother readability and grammatical accuracy.
- In "Chile is a country that never stands out," change "never" to "doesn't often" to provide a more precise gradation of meaning.
- For "We are good at soccer, but Argentina has Messi," consider altering to "We excel in soccer, yet Argentina boasts Messi" to enhance clarity and vary language.
- Adjust "And that's why we drink a lot of it: it's good and cheap, and supposedly good for your health" to "This explains the high consumption: it's affordable, high-quality, and purportedly healthful" for conciseness and formal tone.
- Revise "Let's see how much wine Chileans drink compared to the rest of the American continent" to "Let's examine Chilean wine consumption relative to the rest of the Americas" for clarity and brevity.
- In "Once upon a time, I was young and experienced my first hangover thanks to one of the cheapest wine available, the '120'", delete "Once upon a time," change "I was young and experienced" to "I experienced," and "cheapest wine available, the '120'" to "'120,' one of the cheapest wines available," for a more journalistic tone and clarity.
- Modify "After drinking it illicitly, I know that unscrupulous people would fill it with water so that their parents wouldn't see the difference, and it was so dubious in quality that in fact no one would notice" to "After illicit consumption, some would dilute it with water undetected due to its questionable quality" for clarity and brevity.
- Change "Imagine my surprise when I arrived in New York and saw the generic 120 being a top shelf wine in liquor stores, far from those used more for cooking than drinking" to "Arriving in New York, I was surprised to find '120' positioned as a top-shelf wine in liquor stores, a stark contrast from its culinary use back home" for better readability and clarity.
- For "And its average price here is much higher than in Chile," consider "Here, its average price markedly exceeds that in Chile," for precision and readability.
- Replace "After doing this serious research on liquor stores, I learned the following things:" with "From my detailed liquor store research, I've learned that:" for conciseness and a more direct tone.
- Revise "Staten Island has few options for where to buy Chilean wine, but when they do, it's cheap!" to "Staten Island offers limited Chilean wine sources, yet prices are low when available," for clarity and conciseness.
- Adjust "Brooklyn has ridiculously high prices" to "Brooklyn features notably high prices" for a more formal tone.
- Change "It's not easy to find Chilean Chardonnay or Carmenere in NYC" to "Finding Chilean Chardonnay or Carmenere in NYC poses a challenge" for clarity and active voice.
- For "Not everything is lost. I can still pretend I'm young, drink a not-so-good wine, and not be hangover the next day," consider "All is not lost. I can still enjoy a lesser-quality wine without the hangover the next day, reminiscing my youth," for a more accurate and polished expression.
- In "If reading this made you thirsty, I recommend you to grab a glass of 120 and pair wine with food like an expert:" replace "I recommend you to" with "I recommend that you" for grammatical accuracy.
