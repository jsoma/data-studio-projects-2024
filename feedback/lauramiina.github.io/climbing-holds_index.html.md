## AP Style Feedback

- Change "Confused with climbing lingo? Look no further" to "Confused by climbing lingo? Look no further" to correct preposition use.
- Add a comma after "But if you want to impress your new friends".
- In "They throw around words like crimps, flagging, beta, dynos, and gastons.", consider adding "such as" before "crimps" for precision.
- Change "this 3d guide" to "this 3D guide" for consistency with standard capitalization of acronyms.
- In the Instagram embed code, replace "&amp;" with "and" in text portions, if possible, for readability outside of HTML context.
- Add a comma after "You are excited about your new hobby".
- The phrase "talk with more experienced climbers" could be revised to "talk to more experienced climbers" for consistency with American English usage.
- Revise "Usually, climbers are friendly and like to explain the specifics of the sport." to include a conjunction for clarity, e.g., "Usually, climbers are friendly and they like to explain the specifics of the sport."
- Consider changing "from this 3d guide" to "from this 3-D guide" for consistency with AP style guidelines on numerals and abbreviations.
- In "Dan Krulwich from the Movement Climbing in New York," consider introducing the city before the venue for clarity, e.g., "Dan Krulwich from Movement Climbing in New York City".
- Change "said that as a climber, his favorite holds are crimps" to "said that, as a climber, his favorite holds are crimps" for clarity.
- The phrase "let's take a look at this hold type!" could benefit from removal for a more formal tone suitable for the article's context.
- Replace "The fourth hold is a pinch." with "A fourth hold type is the pinch." for clarity and consistency with the rest of the text.
- Revise "It's not as easy as it sounds." to "This is not as easy as it sounds." for clarity and formality.
- Replace "pinching on wider holds becomes harder" with "pinching wider holds becomes more difficult" for clarity and to avoid colloquial language.
- Amend "Judith Hirsch says she doesn't like to think holds in terms of favorites. Diversity is key!" to "Judith Hirsch says she prefers not to think of holds in terms of favorites, emphasizing that diversity is key."
- In "Still confused about more intricate climbing words?" consider replacing "words" with "terminology" for precision.
- Change "Climbing magazine has great guides to mastering flagging, dynos, gastons, and more." to "Climbing Magazine offers detailed guides on mastering techniques such as flagging, dynos, gastons, and more." for clarity and to treat the magazine name as a proper noun.
- The sentence "Jake Scharfman, Community Liaison at Ground Up Climbing Centre in Squamish, British Columbia, said that his favorite hold type is a sloper." should specify "Squamish, British Columbia, Canada," for readers unfamiliar with the location.
- In the footer, consider changing "You can find the code for this project here." to "The code for this project is available here." for a more formal and direct statement.
- The inclusion of direct quotes and names like "Dan Krulwich" and "Judith Hirsch" should be verified for consent to use in publication, despite the instruction not to verify facts or sources. This suggestion is for ethical considerations outside of AP style.
