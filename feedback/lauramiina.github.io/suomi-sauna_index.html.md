## AP Style Feedback

- Change "Finns love sauna, and build saunas..." to "Finns love saunas and build them..."
- Amend "80 degrees celcius" to "80 degrees Celsius."
- Replace "there are millions of sauna's in Finland" with "there are millions of saunas in Finland" to correct the misuse of an apostrophe.
- Change "at least 80 degrees celcius" to "at least 80 degrees Celsius" for consistency and correct spelling of Celsius.
- Amend "causionary tales" to "cautionary tales" for correct spelling.
- Change "like nights with friends and definitely bachelorette parties." to "including nights with friends and bachelorette parties." for better clarity.
- Amend "On average Finns spend about over an hour taking a sauna every week." to "On average, Finns spend over an hour in the sauna every week." for clarity and correct usage.
- Change "They do not represent all of Finland in any way, and this is just an example of one sauna-going group of people." to "They do not represent all of Finland and are just an example of one sauna-going group." for conciseness.
- In "The youngest sauna-goer in this family is two years old and the oldest is 75." change "two" to "2" and "75" to "75" for consistency with AP style guidelines on ages.
- Replace "half an hour" with "30 minutes" for consistency with AP style's preference for figures.
- Amend "All of them go to sauna at least once a week, most of them more often." to "All of them use the sauna at least once a week, most more frequently." for conciseness and clarity.
- Correct "Details about this project can be found onGithub." to "Details about this project can be found on GitHub." adding a space for correct branding and readability.
- Change "My childhood" to "My Childhood" if it's intended as a subtitle for consistency with capitalizing major words in titles.
- Amend "millions of sauna's" to "millions of saunas" to correct apostrophe misuse indicating pluralization.
- In "One regular Finnish family answered to a survey about their sauna customs." consider changing "answered to a survey" to "responded to a survey" for correctness.
- Correct the branding mistake in "80 degrees celcius" to "80 degrees Celsius" consistent with the proper noun capitalization rule.
- Amend "...life-threatening condition and went right to löyly" by adding the missing subject for clarity, e.g., "...after a life-threatening condition, he went right to the löyly."
- The phrase "For example all the times when someone has cooled off rolling in the snow without checking the surroundings." could be clearer as "For example, consider the occasions when someone cooled off by rolling in the snow without first checking the surroundings." for clarity and grammatical structure.
- In "sauna is for all ages in Finland," consider specifying "The sauna is for all ages in Finland" for clarity and article usage.
