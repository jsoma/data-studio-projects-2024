## AP Style Feedback

- Change "It's a brisk Sunday morning in late February." to "It's a brisk Sunday morning in late February." for consistency in punctuating introductory clauses.
- Amend "This 20-hectare mature forest is left for what once covered much of New York City" to "This 20-hectare mature forest is what's left of the expanse that once covered much of New York City" for clarity.
- Change "It has been taken care of by the Botanical Garden since 1895, and currently goes by the name Thain Family Forest." to "The Botanical Garden has cared for it since 1895, and it currently goes by the name Thain Family Forest." to avoid passive voice.
- In "But that's not by coincidence, says Eliot Nagele," consider revising to "But that's not coincidental, says Eliot Nagele," for smoother readability.
- Modify "This also means that some tree species have had to give space to others." to "This also means some tree species have had to make room for others." for conciseness.
- Change "The forest used to be called “Hemlock Grove” because it dominated the canopy. Also different oaks were very common in the forest." to "Formerly called 'Hemlock Grove' due to its dominance in the canopy, various oaks were also prevalent in the forest." for clarity and conciseness.
- Update "Nagele says that the decline of Eastern hemlock in the forest was already noted in the 19th century and efforts to revitalize the species were taken." to "Nagele notes the decline of Eastern hemlock was documented in the 19th century, with efforts taken to revitalize the species." to avoid redundancy and passive construction.
- In "Nagele and other researchers from the Botanical Garden and Yale University could work with a unique, long-term dataset that has been updated since the 1930's." replace "1930's" with "1930s" to adhere to AP Style regarding decades.
- Revise "The research was published in the Journal of Forestry in February." to include the year of publication for clarity. If the year is this year, the sentence could say, "The research was published in the Journal of Forestry in February 2023."
- Consider rewording "It's the most comprehensive data set of any urban forest that I've seen." to "It's the most comprehensive dataset of any urban forest I've seen." for conciseness and to avoid unnecessary words.
- Adjust "Details about this project can be found on Github." to "Details about this project are available on GitHub." for a more active voice and correct capitalization of "GitHub."
- Change “One of the huge things here is 'management is key', right?” Nagele says." to “'One of the huge things here is management is key,' Nagele says." for proper AP Style quotation punctuation.
- Amend "Openstreetmap.org" in the picture credit to "OpenStreetMap.org" to match the official capitalization of the website name.
- Modify "the fingers are freezing," to "fingers are freezing," for consistency in omitting the definite article where not necessary.
- Replace “He says that using the data in developing and planning the management has been a part of the efforts' success.” with “He says using the data to develop and plan the management has contributed to the success of the efforts.” for clarity and smoother flow.
