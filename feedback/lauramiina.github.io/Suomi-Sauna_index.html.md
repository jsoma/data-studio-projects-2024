## AP Style Feedback

- Change "80 degrees celcius" to "80 degrees Celsius" for accurate scientific term capitalization.
- In the phrase "there are millions of sauna's in Finland," change "sauna's" to "saunas" to correct the plural form without apostrophe.
- Change "all of the holidays, like Christmas and midsummer," to "all the holidays, such as Christmas and Midsummer," to use "such as" for examples and capitalize "Midsummer" as a specific holiday.
- Modify "on the countryside" to "in the countryside" for proper preposition usage.
- Change "eight times" to "eight times," and place it before "in a sauna" for clearer structure.
- Revise "it's usually at least 80 degrees celcius" to "it’s usually at least 80 degrees Celsius," ensuring accurate temperature unit capitalization and correct use of the contraction.
- In the description of the Finnish family's sauna habits, change "answered to a survey" to "responded to a survey" for grammatical accuracy.
- Adjust "more than town houses and dogs combined" to "more than the number of townhouses and dogs combined" for clarity.
- "My sisters and I would sit with our aunt in the dimly lit, humid, wooden panelled room" should be modified to use American English spelling: "wood-paneled."
- The phrase "let me remind you it's usually at least 80 degrees celcius" should be punctuated to include a comma after "you" and correct "celcius" to "Celsius."
- Correct "Usually the sauna is considered healthy, but there are limits. There are a lot of similar causionary tales." by changing "causionary" to "cautionary" for correct spelling.
- Alter "financed’s father" to "fiancé's father" for the correct possessive form of "fiancé" and accurate representation of the relationship.
- The grammatical structure "There was an instance when one Finnish father had just gotten home from the hospital after a life-threatening condition and went right to löyly" could be improved for clarity and flow, but given the guidelines, specific restructuring into multiple sentences or more concise wording would be advised for general improvement.
- Replace "go to sauna" with "go to the sauna" throughout the text for consistency with common English usage patterns.
- Change "For example all the times when someone has cooled off rolling in the snow without checking the surroundings." to "For example, all the times when someone has cooled off by rolling in the snow without checking the surroundings," to add needed punctuation and preposition for clarity.
- Modify "Details about this project can be found on" to "Details about this project can be found at" for proper preposition usage concerning web addresses.
- In "Sauna is for all ages in Finland. On average Finns spend about over an hour taking a sauna every week." consider revising to "Sauna is for all ages in Finland; on average, Finns spend just over an hour in the sauna every week." for improved clarity and punctuation.
- The phrase "all of them are in löyly naked" could raise questions of clarity and might be more appropriately framed as "all partake in löyly naked," though the original text's meaning is clear, suggesting nudity is a norm in the context described.
- While not explicitly incorrect, the informal tone of "drinking redcurrant juice at the cottage with my family." could be considered for adjustment in a more formal editorial context; however, given the guidelines, maintaining the writer's voice is also important.
