# Feedback for [Sauna](https://lauramiina.github.io/Suomi-Sauna/)

## AP Style Feedback

- Change "80 degrees celcius" to "80 degrees Celsius" for proper capitalization and spelling of "Celsius."
- Change "millions of sauna's" to "millions of saunas" to correct the misuse of apostrophe for the plural form.
- Change "more than town houses and dogs combined" to "more than townhouses and dogs combined" to correct compound word usage.
- Change "My sisters and I would sit with our aunt in the dimly lit, humid, wooden panelled room" to "My sisters and I would sit with our aunt in the dimly lit, humid, wood-paneled room" for consistency in U.S. spelling.
- Change "80 degrees celcius" (second occurrence) to "80 degrees Celsius" again for proper capitalization and spelling.
- Change "causionary" to "cautionary" to correct spelling.
- Replace "in Finland if there isn't a possibility to go to sauna" with "in Finland if there's no possibility of going to sauna" for smoother readability.
- Change "On average Finns spend about over an hour taking a sauna every week." to "On average, Finns spend just over an hour in the sauna every week." for clarity and correctness.
- The phrase "usually it is a social event, where there is more than one person in löyly" could be clarified. Consider adjusting to "Typically, it's a social event involving multiple people in the löyly."
- For consistent AP style dates and measurements, ensure you are checking specific guidance on expressions of time, money, percentages, and other quantities to ensure each follows AP style guidelines not explicitly broken down here.
- Ensure numerical figures are used appropriately, for example, starting sentences with numbers should be avoided unless it starts with a year.
- Review hyphenation rules, especially in expressions like "wood-burning stove" to confirm consistent use throughout.
- The sentence "Details about this project can be found on" followed by a URL should have "on Github" outside the hyperlink to clarify the link destination before clicking and to avoid ending the sentence with "on."
