## AP Style Feedback

- Change "Youtube" to "YouTube" throughout the text for consistency with AP style and the official spelling of the brand name.
- Change "grad school" to "graduate school" for formality and clarity.
- Convert "56 million" to "56 million" to adhere to AP style's rule for large figures.
- Convert "65 billion" to "65 billion" to maintain consistency with AP style for large numbers.
- In the date "February 2024," ensure that the future tense is appropriate given the context or adjust accordingly to match the publication date and AP style guidelines.
- Change "4.9 million subscribers" and "2 billion views" to "4.9 million subscribers" and "2 billion views" for consistency with AP style regarding large numbers.
- Spell out the first reference to "ASMR" as "Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR)" before using the acronym.
- Change "1,269 videos" to "1,269 videos" and "4,800 different tags" to "4,800 different tags" to align with AP style conventions for large numbers.
- Ensure that "20 percent" follows AP style, which it does, but verify percentage representation is consistent throughout the text.
- Abbreviate "million," "billion," and any other large number terms consistently after first mention if mentioned multiple times in close proximity for readability.
- Check the consistency and clarity of attributions, such as "says Giulia Poerio, a lecturer at the University of Sussex," to ensure that titles and names follow AP style for academic titles (e.g., ensure "lecturer" is the appropriate title and used correctly according to AP guidelines).
- For any direct quotations, ensure they are attributed in a way that follows AP style, focusing on simplicity and clarity (e.g., "Poerio says.").
- Review the description of sensations and experiences associated with ASMR to ensure descriptions are clear, avoiding subjective interpretations unless directly quoting a source.
- Confirm technical terms related to ASMR and YouTube are used accurately and consistently, as per AP style and industry standards.
- Review use of numbers related to time (hours, years, etc.) to ensure adherence to AP style (e.g., "since the year 2016" could potentially be revised for clarity or conciseness).
- Verify the use of "percent" versus "%" and ensure consistency with AP style throughout the document.
- Check all hyperlinks for functionality and relevance, though this falls slightly outside the copy text, ensuring correct AP style for web references and attributions.
- Ensure all embedded multimedia (e.g., iframes for videos) are accompanied by descriptive and accurate captions or alternative text descriptions, following AP style for clarity and accessibility.
- Ensure the photo credit is in line with AP style guidelines, considering clarity and brevity.
- Double-check that any comparisons or analogies used are clear, relevant, and appropriately attributed, as in the comparison of ASMR sensations to reactions to live music.
- Ensure any references to sensory experiences or medical phenomena are described clearly, avoiding jargon or vague terminology, and that they follow AP style for health and science reporting.
- Review the narrative for any potentially biased language or assumptions about the reader's experience or knowledge of ASMR, ensuring neutrality and inclusiveness in line with AP style for unbiased reporting.
