## AP Style Feedback

Below are editorial suggestions to improve the HTML content according to the AP Style Guide:

1. Change "female genital mutilation (FGM)" to "female genital cutting (FGC)" to use more neutral language.
2. "girl population" should be "female population" for specificity and neutrality.
3. In the sentence "Just as orchids defy the odds and flourish in the most challenging of environments, so too do individuals impacted by the practice of female genital mutilation (FGM).", consider rephrasing to "Just as orchids thrive in challenging environments, so too do individuals affected by female genital cutting."
4. The phrase "at least 200 million individuals living today have undergone FGM" should have "living" removed for brevity: "at least 200 million individuals today have undergone FGC."
5. Convert "44,000 women and girls die each year because of the procedure" to "an estimated 44,000 women and girls annually die due to the procedure" for clarity and conciseness.
6. Adjust "The World Health Organization classified FGM into four categories" to "The World Health Organization classifies FGC into four categories" for consistency in tense.
7. "while a study by the University of Birmingham and Exeter estimates over 44,000 women and girls die each year because of the procedure" could be improved to "while a University of Birmingham and Exeter study estimates over 44,000 women and girls annually die due to the procedure" for clarity and conciseness.
8. In "the practice has been known to cause severe bleeding," consider specifying "FGC has been known to cause severe bleeding" for clarity.
9. "several countries have banned the practice of female genital mutilation" could be more concise as "several countries have banned FGC."
10. The phrase "as of 2023" can be removed for timelessness since no date context is given before this mention.
11. Instead of "religion also plays a role in the practice of FGM," opt for "religion also influences FGC practices" for clarity.
12. Replace "other versions of Islamic jurisprudence considers the practice obligatory" with "some Islamic jurisprudence views consider the practice obligatory" for grammatical accuracy ("considers" to "views consider").
13. The phrase "such is the practice in Indonesia" is vague; consider specifying "This practice occurs in Indonesia" for clarity.
14. Replace "more countries in South Africa have shifted their views on FGM" with "more countries in sub-Saharan Africa have shifted their views on FGC" for geographic accuracy.
15. Use "prevalence declining to 28% by 2021" instead of using past tense "had been" for consistency.
16. Revise the footer text "You can find the code for this data story here. Feel free to message me on LinkedIn." to incorporate a more professional tone and call to action, for instance, "Explore the coding behind this data story on GitHub. Connect with me on LinkedIn for further discussion."
17. Ensure consistency in the use of "female genital mutilation" and "female genital cutting" throughout the document in alignment with the revised terminology preference.
18. In graphics and charts, confirm that percentages and data figures adhere to AP style, specifically in captions and explanatory texts.
19. Ensure all dates, if mentioned, follow AP style for consistency and clarity.
20. Lastly, verify that all external links (e.g., to GitHub, LinkedIn) are accessible and correctly lead to the intended websites for user engagement and credibility.
