## AP Style Feedback

- Change "Feminine Waves: How the Warming Climate Affects the Sex of Sea Turtle Hatchlings" to "Feminine Waves: How Warming Climate Affects Sex of Sea Turtle Hatchlings" for conciseness.
- Remove the comma after "In 2018" in the subhead for consistency with AP style guidelines on commas.
- Change "93 percent" to "93%" for consistency with AP style for percentages.
- Modify "3 hours" to "three hours" as numbers under 10 should be spelled out according to AP style.
- Change "81.86°F" to "about 82°F" and "88.8°F" to "about 89°F" for simplification and to align with AP style's preference for approximate temperatures.
- Adjust "99 percent" to "99%" for consistency with AP style for percentages.
- Correct "the world's warmest year on record, by far," to "the world's warmest year on record" to avoid editorializing.
- Modify "2.12°F" to "2.1°F" and "1.18°C" to "1.2°C" for simplicity and conformity with AP's guidance on rounding temperatures.
- Adjust "November 2023 being the warmest November in NOAA's 174-year global climate record" to "November 2023 being the warmest November in NOAA's 174-year record" to avoid redundancy.
- Change "2023 was" to "2023 saw" for more precise and objective language.
- Modify "around 0.60 °F" to "about 0.6°F" for consistency with AP style's rounding and temperature presentations.
- Change "57°F" to "about 57°F" to match the AP style's preference for approximate temperatures where exact figures are not crucial.
- Rewrite "Data from NOAA only shows" to "NOAA data show only" for conciseness and active voice.
- Remove "just" from "November just so happens to be the start of sea turtle nesting season" for a more formal tone and to eliminate unnecessary words.
- In "the first batches of sea turtle hatchlings had just emerged," consider changing to "the first batches of sea turtle hatchlings emerged" to maintain formal tone and conciseness.
