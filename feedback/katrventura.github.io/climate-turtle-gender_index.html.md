- Adjust "by the year 2100, rising temperatures could cause up to 93% of green sea turtle hatchlings to become female." to "by 2100, rising temperatures could result in up to 93% of green sea turtle hatchlings being female." for conciseness.
- Correct "99 percent of green sea turtles in Australia's northern Great Barrier Reef are female according to a report" to "99% of green sea turtles in Australia's northern Great Barrier Reef are female, according to a report" for consistency with AP style percentage representation.

- Change "The Earth's average land and ocean surface temperature was 2.12°F (1.18°C) above the 20th century, with November 2023 being the warmest November in NOAA's 174-year global climate record." to "The Earth's average land and ocean surface temperature was 2.12°F (1.18°C) above 20th-century norms, making November 2023 the warmest in NOAA's 174-year record." for clarity and conciseness.
- Replace "Land and Ocean temperatures in countries in Southeast Asia with sea turtle nesting sites have increased by around 0.60 °F causing temperatures to rise above 57°F." with "In Southeast Asia, countries with sea turtle nesting sites have seen land and ocean temperatures increase by about 0.60°F, surpassing 57°F." for clarity and conciseness.
- Revise "Data from NOAA only shows the land and ocean average temperatures in a given month and does not reflect the actual temperature of the sand where the sea turtles are incubating their eggs." to "NOAA data only show land and ocean average temperatures for each month, not the sand temperature where sea turtles incubate their eggs." for clarity and conciseness.
