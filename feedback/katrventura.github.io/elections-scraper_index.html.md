## AP Style Feedback

Based on the AP Style guidelines, the following suggestions aim to improve the accuracy, clarity, and consistency of the data journalism piece:

1. Change "64 countries" to "sixty-four countries" because numbers nine and under should be spelled out.
2. Replace "Data sourced from the International Foundation for Electoral Systems via Python, Playwright, and BeautifulSoup" with "Data from the International Foundation for Electoral Systems, obtained using Python, Playwright, and BeautifulSoup," for clarity and to avoid passive voice.
3. For "average voter turnout percentage," consider specifying what is meant by "average" — is this the average across all elections being referred to, or an average of something else?
4. When discussing election boycotts, the phrase "opposition boycotts elections" could be clarified. Specify which opposition and in which country or elections these boycotts occurred to avoid ambiguity.
5. The term "low voter turnout" should have a specific percentage provided or be defined in a clear context to improve accuracy.
6. The mention of "self-described 'coolest dictator'” should ensure quotes within quotes use different punctuation ("self-described ‘coolest dictator’") as per AP style for clarity and correctness.
7. In the phrase "reelected in a landslide win which raised ‘serious concerns’," it might be more neutral to specify who raised the concerns to avoid any impression of bias.
8. The style of dates (e.g., "January," "February," etc.) is consistent with AP style, but ensure when referring to specific dates to use Arabic numerals without st, nd, rd, th.
9. The use of percentages (e.g., "60%") is correctly using figures, which aligns with AP style for numbers 10 and over. Ensure consistency throughout the document.
10. Spell out "percent" instead of using the "%" symbol when not accompanied by a numeral, as per AP style.
11. For the use of the abbreviation "PM" before "Sheikh Hasina," ensure that on first reference full titles are used. For example, "Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina."
12. Ensure that country names and titles of leaders are capitalized properly throughout the piece as they are proper nouns.
13. When mentioning specific legislative titles or military ranks before a name, ensure that they are appropriately abbreviated and capitalized according to AP style.
14. Any reference to financial amounts should use figures and the word "dollar" spelled out (e.g., "$5 million").
15. Ensure that terms related to the internet and technology, like "Python, Playwright, and BeautifulSoup," are consistently capitalized and used correctly concerning AP style guidelines.
16. The term "leftist-populist" used in describing a political party should not be hyphenated according to the most recent AP style guidance on political ideologies.
17. Dates for future elections (e.g., "November 5") are appropriately styled, but ensure that this formatting is consistent across all references to dates.
18. Correct the spelling of "Botswania" to "Botswana."
19. The inclusion of links (e.g., to GitHub and LinkedIn) is appropriate, but ensure descriptive link text is used for accessibility and clarity (e.g., "View the project on GitHub" instead of "here").
20. When referencing direct quotes or titles within the text, ensure quotation marks are used correctly, and punctuation is placed according to AP style.

These detailed points aim to refine the clarity, accuracy, and adherence to the AP style in the provided text. Adjustments should maintain the original meaning and intent of the reporter while ensuring the piece meets the highest standards of professional journalism.
