## AP Style Feedback

- Replace "We Need To Think Long And Hard About Flood Insurance" with "We Need to Think Long and Hard about Flood Insurance" to ensure prepositions are not capitalized in titles.
- Change "A study shows that providing cheaper flood insurance could make flood damage worse in the future than currently predicted." to "A study shows providing cheaper flood insurance could make future flood damage worse than currently predicted" for conciseness.
- Amend "policymakers have the overwhelmingly difficult task" to "policymakers face an overwhelmingly difficult task" for clarity.
- Change "Climate risk assessment is crucial to inform the efforts of policy making." to "Climate risk assessment is crucial for guiding policymaking efforts." for fluidity.
- Modify "called “Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)”." to "called Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)." for correctness in the use of quotation marks.
- In the phrase "Living next to water has its pros and cons.", consider revising to "Living near water has advantages and disadvantages." for formality.
- Replace "But as climate change makes flooding more frequent, do we expect people not to change these preferences?" with "However, as climate change increases flooding frequency, might people change these preferences?" for clarity and to avoid starting a sentence with "But".
- Revise "The problem then becomes a two-way calibration of how population affects flood damage and how the latter affects the former in a dynamic system." to "The issue becomes a bidirectional calibration between population impact on flood damage and how this damage influences population in a dynamic system." for precision.
- Change "these are called “risk-pooling”" to "this is known as 'risk pooling'" for AP style consistency regarding quotation marks and precise terminology.
- Adjust "aim to promote solidarity among households in high- and low-risk areas." to "aim at promoting solidarity among households in high- and low-risk areas." for grammar.
- Amend "Risk-pooling, in effect, passes some of the risk from high-risk properties onto low-risk ones." to "Risk pooling effectively transfers some risk from high-risk to low-risk properties." for brevity and clarity.
- In "using data from SSP2 (the moderately challenging scenario)", consider revising to "using data from SSP2, the moderately challenging scenario," for readability.
- Correct "Max Tesselaar and his colleagues" to "Max Tesselaar and colleagues" to avoid unnecessary possessiveness.
- Revise "A key point made by this study is to bring up the age old question" to "A key point this study raises is the age-old question" for clarity and grammatical accuracy.
- Adjust "that may be a good policy outcome to prevent more sea facing condos from being built in Nice." to "which could be beneficial in preventing the construction of more sea-facing condos in Nice." for flow and formality.
- In the phrase "It might increase even social inequalities", consider revising to "It might further increase social inequalities" for precision.
- Replace "says Max." with "Max states." to maintain formal tone and consistency in attribution.
