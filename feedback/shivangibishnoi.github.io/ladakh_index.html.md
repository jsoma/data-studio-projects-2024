## AP Style Feedback

- Change "21 Days and a Lifetime" to lowercase for "and" in the title to adhere to AP style capitalization in titles.
- Change "Sonam Wangchuk’s climate-fast" to "Sonam Wangchuk's climate fast" to avoid incorrect punctuation and hyphenation.
- In the phrase "Necessity used to be the mother of invention, at least, when human demands were simpler. Then capitalism happened," consider rephrasing for clarity and to maintain a neutral tone.
- Change "In the Himalayan cold desert of Ladakh, Sonam Wangchuk has worked for decades to solve true problems." to "In the Himalayan cold desert of Ladakh, Sonam Wangchuk has worked for decades to solve real problems." for more precise language.
- "Ladakh is known for two things in India- a surreal..." should be changed to "Ladakh is known for two things in India — a surreal..." for correct punctuation.
- Change "More recently Kargil has been replaced with the Siachen glacier- a point..." to "More recently, Kargil has been replaced with the Siachen Glacier — a point..." for proper punctuation, clarity, and capitalization.
- "When the political and administrative status of Jammu and Kashmir was changed from a state to Union Territory in 2019, Ladakh was promised..." should specify "August 2019" for precise date reference.
- Use figures for "Five years and many ploys later..." to adhere to AP style, changing it to "Five years and many strategies later..." for a more neutral tone.
- "The reasons for this U-turn are utterly and depressingly predictable." could be rephrased to maintain an objective tone.
- "He vowed to do a twenty-one day climate fast..." should be "He vowed to do a 21-day climate fast..." to follow AP style for numbers.
- "He ended his 21-day fast on March 27 ..." should include the year for clarity.
- "It is inhabited by a small population of 300,000, which relies entirely on glacial melt water for its water supply." should use figures for "300,000" for consistency with AP style.
- In "A report from the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development in Kathmandu finds that glaciers in the Hindu Kush and Himalaya mountain range region melted 65 percent faster from 2010 through 2019 than in the previous decade," clarify "from 2010 to 2019" for consistency.
- "80% of the current volume..." should spell out "percent" as "80 percent of the current volume..."
- "It’s the largest reservoir..." should change "It’s" to "It is" for a formal tone.
- In "An engineer and echo-architect, he has been the recipient of several national and international awards...", change "echo-architect" to "eco-architect" for correct terminology.
- "The conception of the Ice Stupa is easy to understand." could be revised for objective tone.
- "Their toilets eschew water and use a composting method that provides manure for their apricot and apple trees." could clarify "eschew" to "do not use" for clarity.
- "His daily videos on YouTube and Instagram during the climate-fast..." should change "climate-fast" to "climate fast" for consistency.
- “One cannot help but draw parallels between him and Gandhi.” could be rephrased to maintain objectivity.
