## AP Style Feedback

### Suggestions for Improvements

- Convert "35 percent" to "35%" for consistency with AP style regarding percentages.
- Abbreviate "billion" to "bn" in the phrase "$40bn" for consistency and to align with AP style.
- Change "3 decades" to "30 years" to maintain formality and clarity.
- Replace "real estate prices high" with "real estate prices remain high" for clarity and flow.
- Change "1990" format to "'90" in the data citation to match AP style for decades.
- Use "United States" instead of abbreviating to "US" unless it's part of a direct quote or title.
- Ensure all references to years are consistent; choose either full four-digit years or two-digit abbreviations but do not mix in the same context or comparative data.
- Consider changing "from 1986-2015" to "from 1986 to 2015" for clarity and correctness.
- For the source citation under the small multiplex chart, ensure that the format "Nature 622, 87–92 (2023)" is consistently applied or decide if a more reader-friendly citation format should be used.
- Add commas to large numbers where appropriate for readability, e.g., "from 1985. Nature 622, 87–92 (2023)" should be adjusted if the context indicates numbers in the thousands or millions.
- Ensure that "Jakarta. By 2050," if starting a new sentence, "By" should be lowercase unless it's after a period.
- Revise "a sea-wall which will cost up to $40bn." to "a sea wall estimated to cost up to $40 billion" for clarity and consistency with AP style for currency.
- Correct the phrase "the solution to this problem is a commitment on the part of the government" for clarity. Consider specifying the type of commitment if possible.
- In the section discussing Alan Hsaio's working paper, ensure that "working paper" is the appropriate term for the audience and that his affiliation with Princeton University is correctly stated as either current or past in the verb tense used.
- Verify the spelling of "Alan Hsaio" to ensure it is correct and consistent throughout the text.
- In references to climate change impact, ensure that the descriptions of events like sea-level rise maintain a scientific and neutral tone, avoiding language that might imply speculation without evidence.
- For the small multiples visualization caption, ensure that the title of the article from "Nature" is annotated correctly according to AP style, particularly regarding the use of quotes and italics for article titles.
- Check for consistent use of hyphens in compound modifiers, such as "high-risk flood-prone areas" should be "high-risk, flood-prone areas" if that improves clarity.
- Verify consistency in the treatment of technological terms like "sea-wall," which might be more accurately written as "sea wall" unless quoting a specific source or term used in research.
- Lastly, ensure that every numerical range, such as date ranges and statistical data, is presented consistently, either using "to" or a hyphen, but clearly distinguishing between minus values and ranges.

Each point addresses specific textual changes rather than broader editorial suggestions, focusing on accuracy, clarity, and adherence to the AP style guide.
