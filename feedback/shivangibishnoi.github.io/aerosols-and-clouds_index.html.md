## AP Style Feedback

To enhance the clarity, accuracy, and readability of the webpage content, I suggest making the following specific edits following the AP style guidelines:

- Spell out numbers one through nine, and use figures for 10 and above. For example, change "3 cloud radars" to "three cloud radars."
- Use figures for all ages, amounts, and percentages, except at the beginning of sentences.
- Avoid placing a space between the numeral and the percentage symbol. For instance, change "54 %" to "54%".
- When citing dates, use the AP style for abbreviation. For example, change "February 8 2024" to "Feb. 8, 2024."
- For units of measurement, spell out words such as "billion" and use figures. Ensure clarity in expressions of time, amounts, and distances.
- Use commas to separate thousands in figures above 999. For example, change "399.25925925925924" to "399,259.259" (for simplification, consider rounding the numbers to a more reader-friendly format).
- When referring to hypotheses or scientific terms the first time, it might be helpful to briefly define them or ensure their explanation is near their first mention for clarity.
- Ensure consistency in the naming and abbreviation of scientific terms and theories throughout the text.
- Check for consistency in the spelling of terms, e.g., "aerosol invigoration hypotheses" vs. "aerosol invigoration hypothesis."
- Use "percent" instead of "%," unless in charts or technical sections where space is limited.
- Maintain a formal and consistent tone suitable for a scientific article. Avoid colloquial language unless directly quoting a source.
- In scientific contexts, precise terms should be preferred over general descriptions when referring to data or research findings.
- When listing a series of items, use the serial comma for clarity, except where specifically guided otherwise by the content's technical nature.
- Hyperlink text should be descriptive of the linked content instead of phrases like "click here" or URLs spelled out, unless citing a source in a bibliography or footnote.
- Ensure all external links are functional and lead to the intended information, serving as references or further reading for the audience.
- Titles and subtitles should clearly reflect the content of the sections they head. Consider revisiting section titles to ensure they accurately represent the following paragraphs.
- For better reader engagement and clarity, consider breaking down complex paragraphs into shorter, more digestible sections.
- Use active voice whenever possible to make sentences clearer and more engaging.

These suggestions aim to refine the article according to the AP style guide, improving readability and ensuring the article meets editorial standards for publication.
