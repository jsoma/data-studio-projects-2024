## AP Style Feedback

- Change the article's title to capitalize only the first letter of principal words: "I Asked Four Young Women What Their Favorite Countries Are. Hereâ€™s What They Said."
- Correct the date format for "April 21, 2024" to AP style: "April 21."
- Spell out numbers one through nine: Change "between 21 to 25 years old" to "between 21 and 25 years old" for consistency and clarity.
- Use figures for ages: "Hannah Neves, 23, has traveled to 21 countries" is correct as per AP style.
- For "participate in marine conservation efforts," clarify the agency or organization for clarity and precision if known.
- Throughout the document, ensure all references to "picture" or "pictures" in captions are consistent in phrasing for parallel structure; suggest using "Photo courtesy of [Name]" for all captions.
- Ensure country names and other proper nouns are capitalized: "Seychelles ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¨ is the smallest country in Africa!" is correct, but review for consistency throughout.
- Add clarifying information for all iframe titles currently marked as "[ Insert title here ]" to accurately describe the embedded content for reader clarity.
- Remove the extraneous and redundant "span &nbsp;" elements that appear to serve no purpose.
- Hyperlink protocol consistency: Ensure all external links are HTTPS, not HTTP, for security.
- Correct the Spanish flag emoji (ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¨) designation for the Canary Islands. The Canary Islands do not have their own official country code in the emoji set, and use Spain's (ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸).
- Change "Pacific Ocean" to "Indian Ocean" regarding "the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean meet" in the context of Cape Town, South Africa, as geographically accurate.
- Correct "21 countries" to comply with AP style for countries visited by Yasmin.
- Ensure numerical consistency: when first referencing numbers in a series, use figures for all (e.g., "visited 47 countries, starting her explorations during college").
- Check for consistency and clarity in the description of travel experiences to avoid potential cultural insensitivity or inaccuracies.
- Replace the informal "haha" with a more formal expression or remove it entirely for professionalism.
- Wherever subjective experiences are recounted, ensure they are clearly attributed to the individual for clarity and to avoid generalizations.
- Confirm that the representation of indigenous cultures and places respects community preferences for naming and depiction.
- "Uber" should be capitalized as it's a proper noun.
- Consistency in emoji use for country flags is good for reader engagement but ensure that it does not detract from the professionalism of the document.
- Ensure any mentions of brands like "YouTube" and "Out of Office" are correctly capitalized and represent the brand accurately.
- For any quoted content, such as from TikTok videos or Instagram posts, verify that the quotes are accurate and attributed correctly.
- For safety and travel advice, ensure it reflects the most current guidelines and recommendations.
- In describing food experiences, be culturally sensitive and accurate, avoiding generalizations that might misrepresent the cuisine.
- Revisit the phrase "with my parents when I was 16" for clarity. Consider specifying the nature of the trip more precisely to avoid ambiguity about who was traveling.
- Ensure all mentions of specific locations, like "Queenstown," include the country for readers unfamiliar with the geography.
- When referencing activities like bungee jumping, clarify with the official names of the locations or businesses involved for accuracy and reader interest.
- Ensure video captions directly relate to the content shown, providing context or explanation that adds value for the reader.
