- Capitalize "Spin classes" to "Spin Classes" at the beginning of a sentence.
- In the sentence "I sought out studios that offered a similar format," consider specifying the "format" to improve clarity.
- "60+" should be changed to "more than 60" for clarity and consistency with AP style.
- In "398 cal," spell out and lowercase "calories" for consistency and clarity.
- Use figures for "404.5 calories" and capitalize "Calories" if it starts a sentence. 
- Change "376 calories" to "376 Calories" if starting a sentence for consistency.
- "midpoint" should be hyphenated to "mid-point" for correct usage.
- In the quote, change "I‚Äôm watching the stats through the whole class," to use "I'm" only if it's a direct quote; otherwise, rephrase for formal consistency.
- Change "said Lizzie Trull" to "Lizzie Trull said," following the subject-verb-object structure for clarity.
- "that was one class that completely made me go off" could be rephrased to "there was one class that significantly increased my performance" for clarity.
- Replace ‚ÄúWhen people know and like the song, a lot of this [exercise] is music-driven," with direct attribution if it's a continuation of Trull's quote for clarity.
- Use "more than" instead of "+" in "60+ classes in less than 6 months" for consistency with AP style regarding numerical expressions.
- Change "158 beats per minute (bpm)" to "158 beats per minute" on first mention and later references can be abbreviated as "bpm."
- Abbreviate months with specific dates without using "th," for example, "February 18," not "February 18th."
- Ensure direct quotes are attributed immediately before or after the quote, depending on the structure, for clarity and consistency.
- Include missing verb for "someone ** helped me get on my bike properly."
- Spell out "two" in "2 weeks of classes for just $50" for consistency with AP style for numbers under 10.
- Change "30-class pack, 12 monthly classes," to have numerical consistency, e.g., "30-class pack, twelve monthly classes."
- Adjust "an additional $4 charge" to "an additional four-dollar charge" for consistency in expressing monetary amounts in text.
- In the reference to "20-class pack for $350," consider rephrasing to "20-class pack for 350 dollars" for readability and consistency.
- Avoid using emojis or symbols like "üö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è" in professional journalism to maintain formal tone and clarity.
- Ensure all numerical data presented is consistent with AP style guidelines concerning figures and numerals.
- For "I promise I did not go into cardiac arrest," ensure the tone is appropriate for the intended audience, considering rephrasing for clarity or formality.
