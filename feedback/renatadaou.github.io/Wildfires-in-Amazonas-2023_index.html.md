## AP Style Feedback

- Change "February 4, 2024" to "Feb. 4, 2024" for proper AP style date abbreviations.
- Change "lT95bln6TtMelFwl" in the YouTube iframe link to remove potentially non-functional or unnecessary parameters.
- Use "a.m." and "p.m." in lowercase and follow with periods for consistency and AP style, particularly in segments like "Especially in the middle of the a.m.," should be changed to "Especially in the middle of the a.m."
- In sentences referring to “the Minister of Environment, Marina Silva,” the title should be lowercase when not used directly before her name according to AP style, consider rephrasing to adhere to this.
- The phrase "Amazon River tributaries" should not be capitalized unless part of a proper noun; revise to "Amazon river tributaries."
- In the statement “they canceled classes at the university during this period,” capitalize "University" when referring to a specific institution, if "Federal University of Amazonas" is meant here.
- For "11%," "50%," and similar percentages, spell out "percent" instead of using the "%" symbol for AP style compliance.
- In "almost 50%," consider providing an exact figure or qualify with "nearly" or "about" for precision if "almost" can't be quantified.
- Ensure "Deforestation total area in Amazonas" under the figure caption is capitalized consistently as it's a title; a suggestion could be "Total Deforestation Area in Amazonas."
- Change "valor International" to "Valor International" for proper noun capitalization.
- In descriptions of photos or figures, ensure explanatory text like “The two pictures were also taken by my mother” directly relates to the content for clarity and relevance.
- Re-evaluate the use of informal expressions such as "I’m just glad it’s gone now" for neutral language, although this might be a direct quote.
- Quotes like “It was horrible. Especially in the middle of the a.m.,...” should ensure clarity and AP style for times and potentially break into shorter sentences for readability.
- Verify that the use of "Rhinitis" (currently lowercase) is consistent with medical terminology standards; it generally should be capitalized only if at the beginning of a sentence.
- Consider rephrasing "the fire limits have gone beyond the limits of usually deforested areas" for clarity; perhaps "the fires have spread beyond the customary deforested areas" might be clearer.
- Check if "Manaus, the population" should be rephrased for clarity, possibly to "In Manaus, the population..."
- Ensure consistency in references to environmental agencies or titles, such as "Ibama’s National Center for the Prevention and Control of Forest Fires." Verify capitalization and acronyms are in line with AP style.
- The term "water animals" could be replaced with "aquatic life" for specificity and scientific accuracy.
- For “50% drop in the water levels of the river,” providing an exact measure or clarifying as "nearly a 50 percent drop" could enhance precision.
- Review the use of em dashes and commas for AP style consistency, particularly in complex sentences or asides for readability and adherence to the guide.
- Given that the text is designed for publication, ensure URLs provided in the story are active and lead to the intended sources to maintain credibility and usefulness.
- Where "Federal University of Amazonas" is referred to, ensure that specific names of institutions are consistently capitalized and accurately reflected.
- Ensure all embedded content, like iframes for YouTube or data visualizations, includes descriptive alt text for accessibility and adherence to web standards, which aligns with journalistic standards for inclusivity.
