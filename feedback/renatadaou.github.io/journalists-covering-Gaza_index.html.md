## AP Style Feedback

- Change "Since October 7, the conflicts in the Gaza Strip have consistently made headlines" to "Since Oct. 7, the conflicts in the Gaza Strip have consistently made headlines."
- Change "including on-the-ground coverage, exploration of related themes, and utilization of open-source intelligence techniques" to "including on-the-ground coverage, exploration of related themes, and use of open-source intelligence techniques."
- Change "March 31, 2024" to "March 31" to comply with AP Style for current year dates.
- Change "Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) have" to "Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) has" to correct subject-verb agreement.
- Replace "due to blockades preventing journalists from accessing the area and the hazardous conditions on the ground" with "because of blockades that prevent journalists from accessing the area and hazardous conditions on the ground" for smoother flow and clarity.
- Remove the comma in "techniques, necessitates rigorous verification" to tighten the sentence.
- Change "like X (formerly Twitter) and TikTok" to "such as X (formerly Twitter) and TikTok."
- Change "Haley Willis, a reporter with The New York Times" to "Haley Willis, a reporter with the New York Times" (AP style omits 'The' from newspaper names).
- Rephrase "This form of first-person journalism, primarily consumed by the younger generation, has surged in popularity" to "This first-person journalism format, popular among younger generations, has surged in popularity."
- Change "watching all that unfold" to "watching it all unfold" for a more active voice.
- Change "The main focus of the investigation conducted by the NYT team revolved around a video released by the Israeli military" to "The NYT team mainly focused its investigation on a video released by the Israeli military."
- Remove the placeholders such as "2 “Quote coming - interview next week, sorry”" and replace with finalized content or omit if unavailable.
- Correct "as of March, 2024" to "as of March 2024" to adhere to AP Style on date formats.
- Change "Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories like Gaza" to "Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories such as Gaza."
- In "New York Times video," ensure consistency by using "New York Times" format, previously mentioned correction applies.
- Replace "federal laws that impose restrictions" with "federal laws imposing restrictions" for conciseness.
- Change "90 were Palestinian, 2 were Israeli, and 3 were Lebanese" to "90 Palestinian, two Israeli and three Lebanese" for consistency with AP style on numbers.
- In "has been common with many videos and pictures that became viral on social media platforms," consider rephrasing to "has been common in many videos and pictures that have gone viral on social media platforms" for clarity.
- Change "18.3M followers" to "18.3 million followers" for clarity and AP style adherence.
- Address inconsistent use of "antisemitism" and "anti-Semitism." AP Style uses "antisemitism."
- Correct "Israeli treatment of Palestinians, as well as the creation of a Palestinian State" to maintain consistent style with geopolitical references.
- Adjust "demonstrating the breadth of issues surrounding the conflict." to avoid vagueness and provide specific examples of the issues mentioned.
- For the hyperlink, instead of "click here" or similar phrases, the linked text should provide context about the destination.
- Change 'Motaz Azaiza amassing a substantial following on social media, reaching 18.3M followers as of March, 2024' to 'Motaz Azaiza, who has amassed a substantial following on social media, reaching 18.3 million followers as of March 2024' for more precise and direct language.
- Adjust "as of March 30, 2024, CPJ's preliminary investigations" to "as of March 30, CPJ's preliminary investigations" since the year is self-evident and doesn't align with how dates are typically presented in AP Style.
- Ensure all numerical representations of time, such as dates and years, follow AP style consistently throughout.
- Review the entire document for passive voice instances and change them to active voice where possible to make sentences more engaging and direct.
