## AP Style Feedback

- Change "February 4, 2024" to "Feb. 4, 2024" for date abbreviation.
- "Amazonas" should be lowercase when not used as a proper noun; in the phrase "literally named Amazonas", it is correctly used, so no change needed here, but be mindful in other contexts.
- Spell out "ATVs" to "all-terrain vehicles" on the first mention since acronyms should be avoided unless widely recognized.
- Lowercase "lungs" in "Lungs of The World" unless it's a direct quote or officially named such.
- "October" should specify the year when first mentioned to clarify the timeline since the article covers events from 2019 to 2023.
- Change "October" to "October 2023" in the sentence starting with "However, the city of Manaus..." to provide specific timeframe context.
- "11%" should be spelled out as "eleven percent" to follow AP style guide rules on percentages.
- In "a.m." and "A.C," use "a.m." consistently and clarify "A.C" to its full form "air conditioning" on first mention.
- Change "a.m." to "morning" for clearer understanding and to avoid confusion with time references.
- Ensure "p.m." and "a.m." are lowercase with periods for consistency.
- "50%" should be spelled out as "fifty percent" to align with how to handle percentages.
- The phrase "in the past, fires in the Amazon rainforest were linked to deforestation" could be misinterpreted as subjective. Ensure it is clearly presented as a reported fact or supported by data.
- The term "rhinitis" could benefit from a brief explanation for readers unfamiliar with the condition.
- Replace "seriously" with a more formal tone if used to emphasize credibility in statements about the fog's impact.
- Ensure direct quotes like "It was horrible" are attributed to a specific source when close to other cited information for clarity.
- The phrase "the fires more than usual" is vague and could be rephrased for preciseness.
- In attributing sources, ensure consistency in presentation, e.g., "Sources:" could be followed by a list without leading spaces for each line item.
- The use of "Picture taken of the Rio Negro in October 2023" in the caption under the figure requires consistency in date formatting with the rest of the article.
- The sentence "The two pictures were also taken by my mother." could be rephrased for clarity and to avoid a casual tone.
- URLs in the sources section should be hyperlinked with descriptive text rather than displayed in full.
- The sign-off "Thank you for reading. If you have any questions, please contact me at renatadaou@hotmail.com" could be formalized to align with the overall tone of the publication.
- Check if "CE Noticias Financieras English" should be in italics as a publication name, following AP guidelines for consistency.
- The term "all-terrain vehicles" does not need to be hyphenated; correct to "all-terrain vehicles."
- Ensure Latin phrases like "in situ" or similar are italicized if used, for consistency with AP style on foreign words not commonly adopted into English.
- Verify the use of "email" over "e-mail" following the most recent AP style updates for digital communication references.
- Double-check city, state, and country names against the AP Stylebook for correct styling and abbreviations.
- Review usage of "data" to ensure it aligns with AP style guidance as plural with data points or singular as a data set.
- For the embedded video and iframe elements, confirm that descriptions are clear, accessible, and directly related to the content, even though HTML is not the focus, clarity in presentation matters.
