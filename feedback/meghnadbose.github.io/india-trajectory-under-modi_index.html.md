## AP Style Feedback

- Change the date format in the byline to AP style: "April 21, 2024".
- Lowercase "prime minister" when not used directly before a name: "...decade that Prime Minister Narendra Modi..." to "...decade that prime minister Narendra Modi...".
- Use numerals for the number of eligible voters: "970 million" is correct but clarify this rule for consistency and AP style adherence.
- Remove the comma in large numbers that are not in direct quotations: "almost thrice the entire population of the United States of America." should be streamlined for clarity without altering the quoted numbers.
- The phrase "world's largest democracy is conducting the largest election ever held" could be clarified to specify "India, the world's largest democracy, is conducting its largest election ever held..." for better readability and accuracy.
- Clarify "almost thrice" to "almost three times" for clarity and adherence to a more formal journalistic tone.
- Change "Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party" to "Bharatiya Janata Party" on first reference, adding "(BJP), known for its Hindu nationalist stance," if necessary for clarification in a subsequent reference.
- "Rank has slid from 140 to 161" should be modified to include "positions" for clarity: "rank has slid 21 positions from 140 to 161".
- The number range "from 2019 to 2024" needs clarification since the future year 2024 implies projection rather than past data; suggest rephrasing to reflect accurate temporal context if discussing past trends.
- Ensure numerical consistency by using numerals for all percentages or ranks, especially when discussing changes or comparisons, to align with AP style guidelines.
- "Ranked 140 in 2019 to 142 over the next two years" can be clarified as "ranked 140 in 2019 and then dropped to 142 by 2021".
- Use "YouTube video removals" instead of "Youtube video takedowns" to match formal tone and precise language.
- Replace "skyrocketed" with a more formal term like "significantly increased" for a neutral tone in journalistic writing.
- The claim "India leading in global YouTube video takedowns from October to December 2023" should specify the source for these statistics for credibility and clarity.
- Insert hyphen in "anti-national" when used as a compound adjective before a noun for consistency: "...with critics being branded as 'anti-national'..." is correct, but ensure this rule is uniformly applied throughout the document.
- Enclose the quote in the alt text of Kunal Majumder's image in quotation marks & correct "says" to "said" for consistency in tense and format: "...'In the past three years alone,...since CPJ documentation began in 1992,' said Kunal Majumder, India Representative on the Committee To Protect Journalists (CPJ)."
- Ensure that all external links are relevant and verified, reflecting the best practice for journalistic integrity and digital content.
- The interactive chart instructions should clarify that the user's task is a prediction or estimation to avoid confusion about the nature of the interaction: "Start dragging here to plot your prediction of India's press freedom trajectory."
- The vague "Remember, the higher the ranking, the lesser the press freedom" could be clearer. Suggest specifying "In this index, a higher rank indicates lower press freedom."
- "India's rank has slid from 140 to 161 out of 180 countries" should mention the specific years for each rank to maintain clarity and precision in reporting.
- Lastly, ensure that the overall tone remains neutral and fact-based, especially in the discussion of politically sensitive topics, to adhere to journalistic standards and ethics.
