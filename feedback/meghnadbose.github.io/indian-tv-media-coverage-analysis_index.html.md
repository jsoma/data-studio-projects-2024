## AP Style Feedback

- Replace "Election Year" with "election year" in the headline to avoid unnecessary capitalization.
- Change "18 February 2024" to "Feb. 18, 2024" for the date format.
- Use "percent" instead of "%" after figures, e.g., "at 39 percent."
- Lowercase "government" in "Narendra Modi-led government."
- Remove the comma before "and" in a series (Oxford comma not recommended by AP unless necessary for clarity), e.g., "healthcare, public infrastructure and farmersâ€™ distress."
- Titles of TV shows like "The Newshour with Navika Kumar" and "India Upfront with Padmaja Joshi" should be in quotation marks.
- Use figures for all numbers 10 and above. For example, if there's a reference like "eight primetime shows," it should be "8 primetime shows" if the context allows.
- For consistency and clarity, convert all currency references to figures followed by the word "dollars" with no abbreviation, unless directly quoting a source.
- For any legislative titles, ensure they are abbreviated and capitalized only when used before a name, otherwise spelled out and lowercased.
- Remove any instances of bias-free language that might inadvertently slip into descriptive passages about religion, politics, or individuals.
- Verify all hyperlinks to ensure they point directly to the referenced material without unnecessary redirection or broken links.
- Ensure that technical terms, legal terms, and acronyms are spelled out at their first occurrence followed by the acronym in parentheses if they are to be used again.
- Check the spelling and capitalization of proper nouns, especially names, titles, and institutions, to ensure they are consistent throughout the document.
- Ensure that quotation marks are used accurately around direct quotes and titles of works; direct quotes should be attributed with a clear source immediately following the quote.
- If measurements are mentioned, use figures and spell out "inches," "feet," "yards," etc., for clarity and consistency.
- Geographical names should follow AP style, ensuring U.S. state abbreviations are used after city names and countries or states are spelled out when standing alone.
- Religious terms should be capitalized when referring to specific deities, scriptures, or proper nouns, e.g., "Bible," "Quran." Ensure this is done consistently.
- Political terms, when used as proper nouns (e.g., "Democrat," "Republican"), should be capitalized; when used as adjectives or in a more general sense, they should be lowercased.
- Ensure the use of person-first language when referring to individuals with disabilities or conditions, prioritizing the person before their condition.
- Check that all discussions of criminal activities are reported with specificity and without implying guilt.
- Sports terms, team names, and positions should follow AP style, ensuring that any jargon is clearly understood by a general audience.
- Academic degrees like "bachelor's degree" or "master's degree" should possess the correct apostrophe placement.
- For court cases, use "v." for "versus" and ensure case names are italicized.
- Check all punctuation, particularly the use of commas and periods within quotation marks, to adhere to AP style.
- Ensure temperatures are referred to with figures, except for "zero," and that "degrees" is spelled out on first reference.
- Avoid the use of technical jargon or industry-specific language without a brief explanation for general readers.
