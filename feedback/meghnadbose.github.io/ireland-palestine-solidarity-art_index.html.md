## AP Style Feedback

- Change "When Walls Breaks Barriers" to "When Walls Break Barriers" in the title to correct the verb agreement.
- Change "of a Palestinian woman hugging the body of a child killed in the ongoing Israel-Palestine war" to "of a Palestinian woman hugging the body of a child killed in the Israel-Palestine conflict" to use a more neutral term than "war."
- "between Emmalene and Samia, the woman she had painted. Between Dublin and Gaza." should be revised for clarity and brevity: "forging connections between artist Emmalene Blake and Samia, the subject; and between Dublin and Gaza."
- In the sentence "Emmalene says it broke her heart when she saw it," change "says" to "said" to maintain past tense consistency.
- "The only change she made?" should be revised for formal tone: "The only modification she made was that the shroud covering the child was painted as a Palestinian flag."
- The phrase "In the face of unspeakable tragedy, Samia had found what felt like a personal solidarity more than 2,500 miles away." should be simplified for clarity: "Despite the tragedy, Samia found personal solidarity over 2,500 miles away."
- Replace "‚Ç¨11,000" with "11,000 euros" to conform to AP style for currency.
- Change "Emmalene says her efforts will continue, as will her art for Palestine." to "Emmalene said her efforts and her art for Palestine will continue," for conciseness and to maintain past tense.
- In "On 6th December 2023," change to "On Dec. 6, 2023," for date format consistency according to AP style.
- "Irish üáÆüá™ and Palestinian üáµüá∏ flags fly over calls for a ceasefire in Gaza." Remove emoji flags and simplify to "Irish and Palestinian flags are displayed above calls for a ceasefire in Gaza."
- Before "Come, let‚Äôs take a look.‚Äù add a sentence clarifying the shift in narrative focus for smoother transition: "The solidarity expressed through art extends beyond Dublin to Belfast."
- Correct the spelling of "Refaat Alareer‚Äôs poem ‚ÄòIf I Must Die‚Äô" to "Refaat Alareer's poem 'If I Must Die,'" ensuring apostrophe consistency and correct punctuation within quotation marks.
- Revise "She‚Äôs displaced in Rafah." to "She was displaced in Rafah." for tense consistency.
- Change the informal "got in touch with me" to "contacted me" for a more formal tone.
- In "Her fundraiser has received more than 250 donations so far, and raised over ‚Ç¨11,000 for Samia's family," ensure to specify the time reference for "so far" by adding as of the last update or specifying the date.
- The sentence "It‚Äôs the biggest atrocity in our lifetimes" should specify who "our" refers to or be revised for objectivity.
- For "And it's not just Dublin," revise to "The artistic solidarity is not limited to Dublin," for clarity and formality.
- The feedback "The reporting for this story was conducted during a trip to Ireland and Northern Ireland as part of the Covering Religion course at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism." could be simplified to "This story resulted from a trip to Ireland and Northern Ireland for the Covering Religion course at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism."
