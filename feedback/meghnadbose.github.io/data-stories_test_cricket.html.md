## AP Style Feedback

- Change "On 28 January, as a young Shamar Joseph ripped through..." to "On Jan. 28, as a young Shamar Joseph ripped through..." for correct date format.
- Change "the West Indies a thrilling Test win Down Under, a visiting English side overcame their hosts India in the first Test of a promising series." to "the West Indies a thrilling Test win in Australia, a visiting English side overcame its host India in the first Test of a promising series." to avoid colloquial language and ensure subject-verb agreement.
- Change "eight runs in Brisbane, and only twenty more in Hyderabad." to "eight runs in Brisbane and only 20 more in Hyderabad." to adhere to the numerical rule and remove unnecessary comma.
- Change "has men’s Test cricket become more exciting in recent years?" to "has men's Test cricket become more exciting in recent years?" for correct apostrophe.
- Change "Let’s look at this using two factors:" to "Let's look at this using two factors:" for correct apostrophe.
- Remove the break tags ("<br>") within the list items to comply with the HTML style guidelines, as it is unnecessary for spacing and could be handled with CSS.
- Change "There’s also the question of ties" to "There's also the question of ties" for correct apostrophe.
- Change "1980s" to " '80s" for consistency with AP style regarding decades.
- Change "2010s" to "2010s," when referring to the decade to ensure clarity and consistency, as AP style varies, but clarity is paramount. However, consistency within the document is key, so choose one format and apply it throughout.
- Change "Amit Sinha, co-author of ‘Do Different: The Untold Dhoni’, a book on one of world cricket’s most successful captains," to "Amit Sinha, co-author of 'Do Different: The Untold Dhoni,' a book on one of world cricket's most successful captains," for correct quotation marks and apostrophe.
- Change "“There’s far more positive play (now), there’s more experimentation,” says veteran cricket writer Ayaz Memon." to "\"There's far more positive play now, there's more experimentation,\" says veteran cricket writer Ayaz Memon." for correct punctuation and apostrophe.
- Amend "To measure the closeness of Test matches, this correspondent developed the following rubric - matching victory margins to points on a scale of 1 to 10." to "To measure the closeness of Test matches, this correspondent developed the following rubric: matching victory margins to points on a scale of 1 to 10." for punctuation improvement.
- Change "Win by less than 25 runs, or by 1 wicket" to "Win by fewer than 25 runs, or by 1 wicket" for correct quantification.
- Amend "It’s worth mentioning here that not all draws are boring matches." to "It's worth mentioning here that not all draws are boring matches." for correct apostrophe.
- Change "Test cricket continues to face an existential crisis." to a more neutral stance if possible since "existential crisis" may imply a subjective viewpoint.
- Replace "&quot;" with quotation marks (") in alt text for images for correct HTML encoding.
- Change "Emboldened by T20, they bring the same thing to Test cricket," to "Influenced by T20, they bring the same approach to Test cricket," for clarity and to avoid implying courage without evidence.
- For hyperlink texts, avoid using "here" as link text. Instead, describe the link's destination, like "View the full methodology and code on GitHub" could remain as is, but reconsider "take a look at my other data stories here" to something more descriptive if possible.
- Consider revising "Sinha says that pitches too have had a role to play in this trend of increasing results,..." for clarity. It might be more transparent to specify "Sinha also mentions that the design and condition of pitches have contributed to the increasing number of decisive outcomes,..."
- In the phrase "There’s far more positive play (now), there’s more experimentation,” remove the parentheses around "now" for consistency and flow: "There's far more positive play now, there's more experimentation,..."
- Ensure that quoted material, like "'Do Different: The Untold Dhoni'," uses straight quotation marks (') for consistency with AP style.
- Remove any colloquial phrases or idioms that might not be universally understood, like "Down Under," unless directly quoted or central to the understanding of a culturally specific topic.
