## AP Style Feedback

- Change the date format in the byline to "Feb. 4, 2024" for consistency with AP style.
- In the headline, "5-Day" should not have hyphenation; change to "Five-Day".
- Lowercase "down under" as it is not a proper noun in the phrase "a thrilling Test win Down Under".
- In the sentence beginning with "Test cricket seems to be replete with such tight finishes nowadays," end the sentence with a question mark since it is presented as a query.
- Remove the hyphen in "result-oriented" to follow AP style on compound modifiers not involving an '-ly' adverb.
- Change "the 1980s" to "the '80s" and similarly for other decades mentioned to align with AP style on decades.
- Remove the comma in large numbers that are not expressing decimal points, for example, change "433 Tests played, only 84 were drawn" to "433 tests played only 84 were drawn".
- Correct "men’s Test cricket" to "men's Test cricket" for consistency with AP style on possessive forms.
- The reference to "T20 cricket" should have "T-20" hyphenated for clarity.
- Remove the quotation marks from the alt text of images unless directly quoting someone, to enhance clarity and follow AP guidelines on alt text.
- Ensure any references to "first-class" as in "former first-class cricketer" are hyphenated, as this is a compound adjective.
- When discussing percentages, such as "less than one in five," ensure clarity by rephrasing if necessary for uniformity with AP style indirect numerical references.
- The spelling of "Test match" should be consistent throughout, deciding on either "Test" being capitalized or not for all instances based on context.
- URLs should not be visible in the text. Instead, link relevant text directly (HTML editing advice, but important for readability).
- In the phrase "history of Test cricket," ensure "Test cricket" is consistently formatted throughout the document, either both words capitalized or not based on AP style context.
- Change "a mark so high that it was last beaten in the 1910s." to "a mark this high was last seen in the 1910s" for clarity and smoothness in reading.
- Modify "now" to "as of now," or similar where appropriate, to clarify the time reference when discussing current trends or data.
- When discussing sports positions or roles, such as "captains," ensure consistency in whether these are capitalized or not throughout the document based on AP style for formal titles.
- Ensure consistency in the style of references to books, like ‘Do Different: The Untold Dhoni’ should be in quotation marks not single quotes.
- Clarify any idiomatic expressions like "batting last" to ensure global understanding, unless directly quoting.
- Consider rearranging phrases for clarity, such as changing "batsmen and bowlers" to "batters and bowlers" for gender neutrality and to adhere to evolving sports terminology standards.
- The phrase "Pink-ball cricket too." could be expanded for clarity to readers unfamiliar with the term, mentioning it is a format of Test cricket played with a pink ball for better visibility under floodlights.
- For consistency with AP style concerning numerals, ensure all instances align with the rule to spell out numbers one through nine, and use figures for 10 and above, checking for any exceptions such as ages, percentages, or times.
- Ensure terms specific to cricket, like "innings defeat" or "tied Test," are explained or contextualized briefly for readers who may not be familiar with cricket terminology.
