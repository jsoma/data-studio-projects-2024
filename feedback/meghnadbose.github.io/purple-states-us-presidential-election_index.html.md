## AP Style Feedback

- Change "We Ranked the Purple States of the 2024 US Presidential Election. Here Are The Swingiest States of Them All" to "We Ranked the Purple States of the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election. Here Are the Swingiest States of Them All" for consistency with AP style on U.S. abbreviation and capitalization.
- In "By <span id="author"><a href="https://meghnadbose.github.io" target="blank">Meghnad Bose</a></span> | <span id="date">6 March 2024</span>", change the date format to "March 6, 2024," following the AP style for dates.
- The alt text for the featured image, "In election year, religious issues and Opposition-bashing dominate primetime TV news in India", does not accurately describe the image related to the U.S. election. It should be directly related to the article’s content, like "Map representing purple states in the U.S. 2024 Presidential Election."
- Amend "bachelor’s degree, master’s, etc." to "bachelor's degree, master's," to maintain consistent punctuation with possessive apostrophes as per AP style.
- Capitalize "internet" if used, as per the more recent AP style updates.
- Change “Centre” to “Center” in references to American organizations or locations, aligning with American English spelling.
- In "over the course of this article, we try to quantify the ‘swingy-ness’ of swing states," consider removing contractions for a more formal tone, changing "we try" to "we attempt."
- Modify "the victory margin percentage between Joe Biden and Donald Trump in 2020 was multiplied by 50." to avoid potentially implying that Biden and Trump are the sole participants in 2024, as their candidacy could change.
- For clarity, consider changing "multiplied by half of 50, or 25." to "multiplied by 25 (half of 50)."
- Adjust "victory margin percentage in that election was multiplied by 1.5625." to include a rationale for why this specific figure was chosen, if applicable, or clarify it’s based on a predefined methodology.
- Ensure consistency in hyphenation across terms such as "swingy-ness" to maintain readability and professionalism.
