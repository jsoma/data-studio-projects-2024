## AP Style Feedback

- Change the title from "NYC Highout Dropout Rate" to "NYC High School Dropout Rate" for accuracy. 
- In the header, standardize emoji use or consider removing them to maintain a professional tone.
- "the national high school dropout rate" should be rephrased to "The national high school dropout rate" to follow sentence capitalization rules.
- In the percentage figures, change "8.3%" to "8.3 percent" and "5.2%" to "5.2 percent" to adhere to AP style guide recommendations on spelling out "percent."
- Consider changing "since 2010, the national high school dropout rate" to "from 2010 to 2021, the national high school dropout rate" for clarity on the timeframe.
- "In 2018, the rate hit 5.3%" should be rewritten as "In 2018, the rate was 5.3 percent" for consistency with the AP style guide.
- Consider modifying "David Steiner, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Institute for Education Policy, pointed out some dropout reasons from the broad picture." to "David Steiner, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Institute for Education Policy, identified several broad reasons for dropping out." for clarity and fluidity.
- "They (students who drop out from school) have missed too many days of school, and therefore they are pushed out." could be more concisely written as "Students drop out because they have missed too many days of school, leading to them being pushed out."
- "how was New York City doing at that time?" should be revised to "how was New York City performing at that time?" for more formal language.
- "Bronx County reported a notably" could be adjusted to "The Bronx County reported a notably" for geographical name consistency.
- Change "inadequate/poor academic preparation" to "inadequate or poor academic preparation" for clarity and to avoid using slashes.
- In "not able to pass NY State high school (Regents) tests required for graduation," it might be clearer as "unable to pass the New York State high school Regents tests required for graduation."
- Replace "lack of English language proficiency" with "a lack of English language proficiency" for grammatical correctness.
- "Steiner also points out that students who get a job to make money while they are in school could also lead them to have less time to focus on high school work." could be simplified to "Steiner also notes that students working part-time may have less time for schoolwork."
- "Data shows that the Bronx has the highest dropout rate of students who are economically disadvantaged" could be rewritten for precision as "Data indicate that the Bronx has the highest dropout rate among students who are economically disadvantaged."
- "Steiner also gave more interesting ideas of factors that can lead to dropout." can be rephrased for formality, "Steiner also presented additional factors contributing to the dropout rate."
- In "It reduces attention spans, and makes it more difficult to focus in school and do the homework," consider revising to "It reduces attention spans, making it harder to focus in school and complete homework."
- Change "if a student has the sense" to "if students feel," for consistency in addressing the audience.
- Replace "For most of them (high school students), they would get B's, go to the state college or whatever it is," with "Most students, achieving B grades, might attend a state college," for clarity and professionalism.
- Consider revising "Wisconsin announced that if a student is in the top 5% of his or her graduating high school, he or she would automatically go to the flagship university." to "Wisconsin announced that students in the top 5 percent of their graduating class would automatically qualify for admission to the flagship university." for conciseness and to adhere to AP style guidelines.
