## AP Style Feedback

Here's a list of specific text changes based on AP style guidelines for the provided HTML page:

1. Replace "hot off the presses" with "recently published" to avoid clich√©s and ensure clarity.
2. Change "smarty-pants" to "expert" to maintain a professional tone.
3. Use figures for all numbers above nine, so change "about three years" to "about three years."
4. Ensure abbreviations are clear on first mention before using them. Therefore, add "(MIT)" after "Massachusetts Institute of Technology" if this is its first mention.
5. Spell out single-digit numbers. Convert "one through nine" to "one through nine."
6. Ensure consistency in the treatment of time, so if using a.m. or p.m., add this distinction to "Wednesday" to specify the timing, if known.
7. In direct quotes, if there's unconventional usage or an error, insert [sic] if the quote is verbatim and contains errors or unusual expressions. If no errors are present or changes are made, disregard.
8. Avoid starting a sentence with figures. Rewrite sentences like "2022, the Greenland ice sheet..." to begin with words.
9. Correct "Greeland" to "Greenland" in all instances where it's misspelled.
10. Ensure proper noun capitalization, such as "North Pole" and "South Pole."
11. With percentages, use numerals and the word "percent," so check for any deviations and correct them. For instance, "3.4% loss."
12. For dates, abide by AP style: spell out months with five or more letters if they stand alone or with a year but not a day. "April 2024" is correct, but abbreviate if with a specific date: "Apr. 4, 2024."
13. Ensure that geographic names follow AP style preferences for cities, states, and countries, adjusting any deviations found.
14. Verify that titles before names are capitalized, but those used in a more general sense are not. Correct as necessary.
15. Use commas in a series, including before the conjunction, known as the Oxford or serial comma.
16. Replace informal language or colloquialisms with formal equivalents, for example, change "mess with" to "affect" or "impact."
17. Correct any instances of passive voice where active voice could make a sentence clearer or more direct.
18. Ensure that measurement units follow AP style. For instance, use figures for dimensions, temperature, distance, etc., followed by the word: "6 feet," "40 degrees."
19. Verify that the abbreviation for "versus" in court cases, sports games, etc., is "v." without italics.
20. Check for consistency in the use of italics for emphasis or titles, ensuring alignment with AP style guidelines.
21. Confirm that digital content mentions like websites, apps, and social media platforms are up-to-date and correctly formatted.
22. In lists and bullet points, ensure parallel structure for clarity and readability.
23. Verify the use of hyphenation for compound modifiers (e.g., "record-setting performance").
24. Ensure correct use of apostrophes in contractions and possessive forms.
25. Verify the correct use of quotation marks around direct quotes, titles of works, and in other applicable cases as per AP style.
26. Verify numbers used: Spell out numbers one through nine, and use numerals for 10 and above.
27. Check dates to follow the AP style: abbreviate months longer than five letters when a specific date is mentioned, and use numerals without st, nd, rd, or th.
28. Review state names to ensure they are spelled out when standing alone and abbreviated in conjunction with a city (excluding Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Ohio, Texas, and Utah).
29. Ensure that technology terms, especially newer ones, are used correctly and explained if necessary.
30. Verify consistency and correctness in the treatment of climate change terminology, adhering to the most recent guidelines and consensus for scientific terms.
31. Check that the use of numbers in reference to temperature adheres to AP style (e.g., "temperatures rose to the mid-70s").
32. Do not italicize or quote laws, acts, or doctrine names unless part of a direct quotation.
