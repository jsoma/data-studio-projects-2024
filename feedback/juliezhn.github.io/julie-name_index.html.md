## AP Style Feedback

- Change "Is Julie an outedated name?" to "Is Julie an Outdated Name?" to correct spelling and use title case.
- Delete emoji from the main heading as it is not a standard practice in professional news titles.
- Change "22-year-old girl" to "22-year-old woman" for more appropriate and respectful language.
- Correct the sentence with double question marks after "When 'Julie' was a popular baby girl name??" to "When Was 'Julie' a Popular Baby Girl Name?" to correct grammar and use title case.
- In the sentence starting "According to the United States Social Security Administration," rephrase to start immediately with "The Social Security Administration reports ..." to avoid unnecessary filler and ensure accuracy and respect for the source.
- Change “I searched for my name on Google.” to “I searched my name on Google.” for conciseness.
- Rephrase "One day, out of curiosity, I searched for my name on Google." to "One day, curious, I Googled my name." for conciseness and modern language use.
- Replace “girl” with “woman” or "individual" in "So, as a 22-year-old girl," to maintain respectful and age-appropriate language.
- Remove the comma in "Indeed, I often discovered" for conciseness, making it "Indeed I often discovered."
- In "Nowadays, “Julia,” “Juliette,” or even “Julianna” seem to be more popular," use "are" instead of "seem to be" to assert fact rather than perception, if backed by data.
- Change "What was the origin of 'Julie'?" to "What Is the Origin of 'Julie'?" to maintain present tense consistency.
- Ensure consistency in referring to historical time frames by changing all historical references to the past tense where it switches inconsistently, e.g., changing "The first appearance of Julie was" to "The first recorded use of 'Julie' was."
- Correct repetitive phrases like "in the 2000s, the time I was born (ah-oh…)." Consider rephrasing or removing "(ah-oh…)" for professional tone.
- Correct the informal tone and potential typo in "Before the 1950s, Julie was not that popular." Suggest "Before the 1950s, 'Julie' was less common."
- Replace double quotes with single quotes in HTML attributes for consistency, such as in `<a href=“https://github.com/JulieZhn/nyc-dropout-rate”>` to `<a href='https://github.com/JulieZhn/nyc-dropout-rate'>`.
- Change "narrative medicine degree candidate" to "Narrative Medicine degree candidate" to correctly capitalize specific degree programs.
- Modify "attended the journalism school here before" to "previously attended the journalism school here" for clarity.
- Ensure numerical data is precise; rephrase "303k Jessicas and 462k Michaels" to "303,118 Jessicas and 462,390 Michaels" if exact figures are available and relevant.
- Change "ah-oh…" to a more formal expression or remove it for professionalism.
- Consider specifying "By the 1990s, it (Julie) dropped even further" to provide clearer context for "it."
- Clarify and correct the URL displayed as text in "You can find the code for this template here." Ensure the hyperlink text is descriptive, e.g., "Find the template's code on GitHub."
