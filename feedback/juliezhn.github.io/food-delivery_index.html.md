- Replace "218 billion U.S. dollars" with "$218 billion" and "76 billion dollars" with "$76 billion" for consistency with AP style guidelines on currency.

- Replace "sparks discussions about whether ordering online and receiving food deliveries in such conditions is ethical or not" with "raises questions about the ethics of ordering food online under such conditions" for clarity and conciseness.

- Modify "Not only in the U.S.," to "Beyond the U.S.," for smoother transition and clarity in global context.
